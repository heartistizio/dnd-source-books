It also has the following additional properties. When one of these properties is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Lightning.</strong> When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the target to take an extra 2d6 lightning damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Thunder.</strong> When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of thunder, audible out to 300 feet. The target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Lightning Strike.</strong> You can use an action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff's tip in a line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Thunderclap.</strong> You can use an action to cause the staff to issue a deafening thunderclap, audible out to 600 feet. Each creature within 60 feet of you (not including you) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't deafened.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Thunder and Lightning.</strong> You can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties at the same time. Doing so doesn't expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.</p>","unidentified":"Staff"},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook pg 204","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attuned":false,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"Very Rare","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":5,"long":5,"units":"ft."},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"str","actionType":"mwak","attackBonus":2,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["1d6","bludgeoning"]],"versatile":"1d8"},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"weaponType":"simpleM","properties":{"amm":false,"fir":false,"fin":false,"hvy":false,"lgt":false,"lod":false,"rch":false,"rel":false,"spc":false,"thr":false,"two":false,"ver":true,"ret":false,"foc":false,"ada":false,"mgc":true,"sil":false},"proficient":false},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Staff","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/19/193/636382353912825426.jpeg","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/7/428/636284771044710531.jpeg","filterType":"Staff","tags":["Damage","Control","Debuff","Combat"],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":2},{"sourceId":2,"pageNumber":204,"sourceType":1}],"pictureUrl":"modules/dnd-source-books/images/item-large-Staff-of-Thunder-and-Lightning.jpeg"},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":4770,"originalName":"Staff of Thunder and Lightning"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":0,"rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":true,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/items/weapons/staff-blue.jpg","effects":[],"_id":"9R4IYpUJi4csVJBC"}

A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>\r\n<p>If you press <strong>button 1</strong>, the rod becomes a flame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head (you choose the type of sword).</p>\r\n<p>If you press <strong>button 2</strong>, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\r\n<p>If you press <strong>button 3</strong>, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\r\n<p>If you press <strong>button 4</strong>, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>\r\n<p>If you press <strong>button 5</strong>, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.</p>\r\n<p>If you press <strong>button 6</strong>, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Drain Life.</strong> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.

The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Six Buttons.</strong> You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>\r\n<p>If you press <strong>button 1</strong>, the rod becomes a flame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head (you choose the type of sword).</p>\r\n<p>If you press <strong>button 2</strong>, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\r\n<p>If you press <strong>button 3</strong>, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\r\n<p>If you press <strong>button 4</strong>, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>\r\n<p>If you press <strong>button 5</strong>, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.</p>\r\n<p>If you press <strong>button 6</strong>, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.)
