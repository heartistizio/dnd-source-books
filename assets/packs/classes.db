These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s myst<span class=\"No-Break\">erious rites.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Bonus Cantrip</b></p>\n<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.</p>\n\n<p><b>Natural Recovery</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Circle Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land &mdash; arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark &mdash; and consult the associated list of spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Arctic</h5>\r\n<table

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.</p>\r\n<h5>Beast Shapes</h5>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-12\">\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">Level</p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">Max CR</p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Limitations</p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Example</p>\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\" style=\"text-align: center;\">2nd</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">1/4</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">No flying or swimming speed</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Wolf</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">4th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">1/2</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">No flying speed</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Crocodile</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">8th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">1</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">&mdash;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Giant eagle</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><br />You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druid Circle</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p>\n\n<p><b>Beast Spells</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.</p>\n\n<p><b>Archdruid</b></p>\n<p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell.

You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After- ParaOverride-3\">In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.</p>\r\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\">\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Affinity</th>\r\n<th>Spell</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Good</td>\r\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">cure wounds</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Evil</td>\r\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">inflict wounds</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Law</td>\r\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">bless</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Chaos</td>\r\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">bane</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Neutrality</td>\r\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">protection from evil and good</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\n\n<p><b>Favored by the Gods</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.o2giXVHG9UFGqqGR]{Favored by the Gods}</p>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, divine power guards your destiny.

You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spell Slots</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">burning hands</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">burning hands</span> using either slot.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Sorcery Points</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Flexible Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points.

These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds.</p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Speech of the Woods</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.ffX2gFD08ViLbpUC]{Speech of the Woods}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn’t grant you friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spirit Totem</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.6RCfDS2RjXP237uP]{Spirit Totem}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, you can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you’re incapacitated.

Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain&nbsp;advantage&nbsp;on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Hawk Spirit.</span></strong>&nbsp;The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit’s aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have&nbsp;advantage&nbsp;on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Unicorn Spirit.</span></strong>&nbsp;The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain&nbsp;advantage&nbsp;on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit’s aura. In addition, if you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mighty Summoner</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.4dEzDU0NAMOdi1Tm]{Mighty Summoner}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After-\">Starting at 6th level, beasts and fey that you conjure are more resilient than normal.

If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated against your will, you can immediately gain the benefits of <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\"><em>conjure animals</em>&nbsp;</span>as if it were cast using a 9th-level spell slot. It summons four beasts of your choice that are challenge rating 2 or lower. The conjured beasts appear within 20 feet of you. If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes. The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no concentration, or until you dismiss it (no action required).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druidic</b></p>\n<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.</p>\r\n<h5>Beast Shapes</h5>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-12\">\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">Level</p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">Max CR</p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Limitations</p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Example</p>\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\" style=\"text-align: center;\">2nd</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">1/4</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">No flying or swimming speed</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Wolf</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">4th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">1/2</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">No flying speed</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Crocodile</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">8th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">1</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">&mdash;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Giant eagle</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><br />You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druid Circle</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p>\n\n<p><b>Beast Spells</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.</p>\n\n<p><b>Archdruid</b></p>\n<p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>","requiredLevel":2,"displayOrder":5},{"id":168,"name":"Wild Shape Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed.

As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted--Extra-Space-After-\">If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hex Warrior</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.bpMdNwytTC0I2UPa]{Hex Warrior}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon’s type.</p>\n\n<p><b>Accursed Specter</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.JQIOKDz71VZJQbCe]{Accursed Specter}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it to your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter, the statistics for which are in the <em><a title=\"Monster Manual\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm\">Monster Manual</a></em>. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can’t use the feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Armor of Hexes</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.TrRNynNE9gQliw2n]{Armor of Hexes}</p>\n<p>At 10th level, your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.</p>\n\n<p><b>Master of Hexes</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.LSWKbTN9UWaGDIB2]{Master of Hexes}</p>\n<p>Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade’s Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren’t incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don’t regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who ange<span class=\"No-Break\">r their gods.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Acolyte of Nature</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.3YlA1Xa6nS6sluzc]{Acolyte of Nature}</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you learn one druid cantrip of your choice. You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival.</p>\n\n<p><b>Bonus Proficiency</b></p>\n<p>Also at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity: Charm Animals and Plants</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.2czoxSzsqbJqgjlS]{Channel Divinity: Charm Animals and Plants}</p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to charm animals and plants.</p>\r\n<p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Each beast or plant creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate.</p>\n\n<p><b>Dampen Elements</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.Ggn2DfsEUJ2b4jeb]{Dampen Elements}</p>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Strike</b></p>\n<p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold, fire, or lightning damage (your choice) to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Master of Nature</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.182psrfe88wZl8CF]{Master of Nature}</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to command animals and plant creatures. While creatures are charmed by your Charm Animals and Plants feature, you can take a bonus action on your turn to verbally command what each of those creatures will do on its next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Cleric)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=2&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the cleric spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Domain</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for details on all the domains.Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Domain Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each domain has a list of spells &mdash; its domain spells &mdash; that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Destroy Undead</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Destroy Undead Table</h4>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">Cleric Level</p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Destroys Undead of CR ...</p>\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">5th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1/2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">8th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">11th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">14th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">3 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">17th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">4 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Intervention</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days.

You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>\n\n<p><b>Pact Boon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Metadata\">At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service.

The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura’s effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If your aura’s effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Storm Soul</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.0cCLeEizEBbuQiGA]{Storm Soul}</p>\n<p id=\"StormAura\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude compendium-hr\">At 6th level, the storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn’t active. The benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.</p>\r\n<h5>Desert</h5>\r\n<p>You gain resistance to fire damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme heat, as described in the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>. Moreover, as an action, you can touch a flammable object that isn’t being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.</p>\r\n<h5>Sea</h5>\r\n<p>You gain resistance to lightning damage, and you can breathe underwater. You also gain a swimming speed of 30 feet.</p>\r\n<h5>Tundra</h5>\r\n<p>You gain resistance to cold damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme cold, as described in the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>. Moreover, as an action, you can touch water and turn a 5-foot cube of it into ice, which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature is in the cube.</p>\n\n<p><b>Shielding Storm</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.UWw9T0RnnN6thqcQ]{Shielding Storm}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 10th level, you learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice has the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul feature while the creature is in your Storm Aura.</p>\n\n<p><b>Raging Storm</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.Ar1h8xiHhtRlqsVg]{Raging Storm}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 14th level, the power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.</p>\r\n<h5>Desert</h5>\r\n<p>Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes fire damage equal to half your barbarian level.</p>\r\n<h5>Sea</h5>\r\n<p>When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave.</p>\r\n<h5>Tundra</h5>\r\n<p>Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.</p>\n\n<p><b>Rage</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reckless Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Danger Sense</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells.

Driven to seek the adventure and mystery across and beneath every endless oceanic expanse, paladins who swear this oath stand against those who would deny the liberties afforded to likeminded travelers, rooting out the tyrannical and corrupt that claim any shore. Such guardians believe in the natural beauty of the sea, often making offerings and prayers to entities or deities like the Wild Mother or Storm Lord that influence safe passage, while often feeling called to hunt those monstrosities that seek to terrorize and spoil the waters with wanton violence and ill intent.</p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Marine Layer.</strong></em> As an action you can channel the sea to create a thick cloud of fog that surrounds you and heavily obscures the area for 20 feet in all directions, following you as you move. You and all creatures within 5 feet of you instead treat this fog as lightly obscured. This fog lasts for 10 minutes, spreads around corners and cannot be dispersed.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Fury of the Tides.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can channel the powerful might of the waves to bolster your attacks for 1 minute. Once per turn for the duration, when you hit a creature with weapon attack, you can choose to push the target 10 feet away from you. If the target is pushed into an obstacle or another creature, they take additional bludgeoning damage equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Oath Spells</b></p>\n<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Open Seas Spells table.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">hallow</span> spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.

You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level &times; 5.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Paladin)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=4&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the paladin&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Smite</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Health</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sacred Oath</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Oath Spells</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Protection</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Courage</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Improved Divine Smite</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cleansing Touch</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura Improvements</b></p>\n<p>At 18th level, the range of your auras increase to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>All armor, shields<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Simple weapons, martial weapons<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Wisdom, Charisma<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d10 per paladin level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>10 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels: </span></strong>1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per paladin level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 82","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"half"},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":4,"data":{"id":4,"name":"Paladin","description":"<p>A holy warrior bound to a sacred oath</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d10<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Strength &amp; Charisma<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Wisdom &amp; Charisma</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a martial weapon and a shield or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) two martial weapons</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) five javelins or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple melee weapon</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a priest’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Chain mail and a holy symbol</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/364/636272701936950702.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/365/636272701937419552.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/6/636336417477714942.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/paladin","spellCastingAbilityId":6,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":82,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":10,"classFeatures":[{"id":260,"name":"Divine Sense","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s myst<span class=\"No-Break\">erious rites.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Bonus Cantrip</b></p>\n<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.</p>\n\n<p><b>Natural Recovery</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Circle Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land &mdash; arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark &mdash; and consult the associated list of spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Arctic</h5>\r\n<table

nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Nature’s Ward</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Nature’s Sanctuary</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druidic</b></p>\n<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druid Circle</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p>\n\n<p><b>Beast Spells</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.</p>\n\n<p><b>Archdruid</b></p>\n<p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>","requiredLevel":2,"displayOrder":5},{"id":168,"name":"Wild Shape Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed.

As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC.

You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Dark Delirium</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.fKZmkCjtn0IMzGBu]{Dark Delirium}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm.

On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

Some enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall somewher<span class=\"No-Break\">e in between.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Enchantment Savant</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.mMUDD3iUav0k0qwh]{Enchantment Savant}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hypnotic Gaze</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.sfjWVzCzd6U7duwt]{Hypnotic Gaze}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature’s speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Instinctive Charm</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.lGHgewblLTVRVXlI]{Instinctive Charm}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack’s range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.</p>\n\n<p><b>Split Enchantment</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.9a07snsLLkSNFU3l]{Split Enchantment}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, when you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.</p>\n\n<p><b>Alter Memories</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.r9qHyHBdAeR6rB56]{Alter Memories}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature’s understanding so that it remains unaware of being charmed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can’t exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Recovery</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation&nbsp;is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spell Mastery</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>\n\n<p><b>Signature Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor:</span></strong> None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Intelligence, Wisdom<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d6 per wizard level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>6 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels: </span></strong>1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 112","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"full"},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":8,"data":{"id":8,"name":"Wizard","description":"<p>A scholarly magic-user capable of manipulating the structures of reality</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d6<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong>&nbsp;Intelligence<br /><strong>Saves:</strong>&nbsp;Intelligence &amp; Wisdom</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a quarterstaff or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dagger</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a component pouch or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an arcane focus</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a scholar’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A spellbook</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/356/636272696880643718.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/357/636272696881281556.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/11/636336418370446635.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/wizard","spellCastingAbilityId":4,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":112,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":6,"classFeatures":[{"id":328,"name":"Ability Score Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3},{"id":411,"name":"Arcane Recovery","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook.

You may use them to craft ammunition at half the cost, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM’s discretion). Some extremely experimental and intricate firearms are only available through crafting.</p>\r\n<h5><strong>Firearm Properties</strong></h5>\r\n<p>Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Reload.</em></strong> The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Misfire.</strong></em> Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Explosive.</strong></em> Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</p>\r\n<h5><strong>Ammunition</strong></h5>\r\n<p>All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.</p>\r\n<h5>Firearms</h5>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Name</th>\r\n<th>Cost</th>\r\n<th>Ammo</th>\r\n<th>Damage</th>\r\n<th>Weight</th>\r\n<th>Range</th>\r\n<th>Properties</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Palm Pistol</td>\r\n<td>50g</td>\r\n<td>2g (20)</td>\r\n<td>1d8 piercing</td>\r\n<td>1 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(40/160)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>Light, reload 1, misfire 1</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Pistol</td>\r\n<td>150g</td>\r\n<td>4g (20)</td>\r\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\r\n<td>3 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(60/240)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Reload 4, misfire 1</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Musket</td>\r\n<td>300g</td>\r\n<td>5g (20)</td>\r\n<td>1d12 piercing</td>\r\n<td>10 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(120/480)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 2</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Pepperbox</td>\r\n<td>250g</td>\r\n<td>4g (20)</td>\r\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\r\n<td>5 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(80/320)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Reload 6, misfire 2</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Blunderbuss</td>\r\n<td>300g</td>\r\n<td>5g (5)</td>\r\n<td>2d8 piercing</td>\r\n<td>10 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(15/60)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 2</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Bad News</td>\r\n<td>Crafted</td>\r\n<td>10g (5)</td>\r\n<td>2d12 piercing</td>\r\n<td>25 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(200/800)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 3</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Hand Mortar</td>\r\n<td>Crafted</td>\r\n<td>10g (1)</td>\r\n<td>2d8 fire</td>\r\n<td>10 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(30/60)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 3, explosive</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\n\n<p><b>Adept Marksman</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.RGchstfEb8NOMrXs]{Adept Marksman}</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to perform powerful trick shots to disable or damage your opponents using your firearms.</span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>Trick Shots.</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You learn two trick shots of your choice, which are detailed under &ldquo;Trick Shots&rdquo; below.

As a bonus action, you transform for 1 minute. You gain the following benefits while transformed:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your warlock level.</li>\r\n<li>Once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw, and if the saving throw fails, the target is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</li>\r\n<li>You are immune to the frightened condition.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can transform a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p>The appearance of your Form of Dread reflects some aspect of your patron. For example, your form could be a shroud of shadows forming the crown and robes of your lich patron, or your face might transform into bat-like features due to your vampire patron.</p>\n\n<p><b>Grave Touched</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.4hlUA8GcsbvSHYxZ]{Grave Touched}</p>\n<p><em><em>6th-level Undead feature</em></em></p>\r\n<p>Your patron’s powers have a profound effect on your body and magic. You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack and roll damage against the creature, you can replace the damage type with necrotic damage. While you are using your Form of Dread, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the necrotic damage the target takes.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mortal Husk</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.gkAdCYygfDdzMvmt]{Mortal Husk}</p>\n<p><em><em>10th-level Undead feature</em></em></p>\r\n<p>Your connection to undeath and necrotic energy now saturates your body. You have resistance to necrotic damage. If you are transformed using your Form of Dread, you instead become immune to necrotic damage.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can cause your body to explode. Each creature within 30 feet of you takes necrotic damage equal to 2d10 + your warlock level.

As an action, you can project your spirit from your body. The body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation.</p>\r\n<p>Your spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). When your projection ends, your spirit returns to your body or your body magically teleports to your spirit’s space (your choice).</p>\r\n<p>While projecting your spirit, you gain the following benefits:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your spirit and body gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>\r\n<li>When you cast a spell of the conjuration or necromancy school, the spell doesn’t require verbal, somatic, or material components that lack a gold cost.</li>\r\n<li>You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.</li>\r\n<li>While you are using your Form of Dread, once during each of your turns when you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">witch bolt</span>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher.

See its game statistics in the Drake Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. When you summon the drake, choose a damage type listed in its Draconic Essence trait. You can determine the cosmetic characteristics of the drake such as its color, scale texture, or any visible effect of its Draconic Essence; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.</p>\r\n<p>In combat, the drake shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the drake can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>\r\n<p>Once you summon the drake, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to summon it.</p>\r\n<p>The drake remains for a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the drake again, or until you die.

Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark.

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> using either slot.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n\n<p><b>Ranger Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: the Hunter that is detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Primeval Awareness</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Land’s Stride</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">entangle</span> spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are.

The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them. Deities of this domain include Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.</p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Domain Spells</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.pAOnuRolwbBNOjmn]{Domain Spells}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Forge Domain Spells table.

Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it’s armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it’s&nbsp;a weapon.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity: Artisan's Blessing</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.PUCQyICfTTutl0Kt]{Channel Divinity: Artisan's Blessing}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create simple items.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal: a simple or martial weapon, a suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object (see chapter 5, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,&rdquo; in the <em><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em>&nbsp;for examples of these items). The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual’s end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the&nbsp;creation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.</p>\n\n<p><b>Soul of the Forge</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.CE0tBygX8n7VAu8k]{Soul of the Forge}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After-\">Starting at 6th level, your mastery of the forge grants you special&nbsp;abilities:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You gain resistance to fire damage.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Divine Strike</b></p>\n<p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the fiery power of the forge. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Saint of Forge and Fire</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.OLWdRfJTTkPY61UN]{Saint of Forge and Fire}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After-\">At 17th level, your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more&nbsp;powerful:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You gain immunity to fire damage.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">While wearing heavy armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Domain</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for details on all the domains.Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Domain Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each domain has a list of spells &mdash; its domain spells &mdash; that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Destroy Undead</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Destroy Undead Table</h4>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">Cleric Level</p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Destroys Undead of CR ...</p>\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">5th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1/2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">8th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">11th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">14th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">3 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">17th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">4 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Intervention</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days.

A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Battle Magic</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.WWz9Pi9NlxmUF7Y2]{Battle Magic}</p>\n<p>At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious act.

You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spell Slots</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</span></p>\r\n<p><b>Spell save DC </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\r\n<p><b>Spell attack modifier </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Ritual Casting</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Focus</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use a musical instrument (see the <a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Tools\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tools</span></a> section) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bardic Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Jack of All Trades</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Song of Rest</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bard College</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore detailed at the end of the class description or another from the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Player's Handbook</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or other sources.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Font of Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Countercharm</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Superior Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor</span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">:</span></strong> Light armor<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons:</span></strong> Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools:</span></strong> Three musical instruments of your choice<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws:</span></strong> Dexterity, Charisma<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills:</span></strong> Choose any three</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice:</span></strong> 1d8 per bard level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per bard level after 1st</p>\n\n<p><b>Magical Secrets</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice.

Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature on it again.

See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Recovery</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation&nbsp;is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spell Mastery</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>\n\n<p><b>Signature Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor:</span></strong> None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Intelligence, Wisdom<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d6 per wizard level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>6 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels: </span></strong>1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 112","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"full"},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":8,"data":{"id":8,"name":"Wizard","description":"<p>A scholarly magic-user capable of manipulating the structures of reality</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d6<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong>&nbsp;Intelligence<br /><strong>Saves:</strong>&nbsp;Intelligence &amp; Wisdom</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a quarterstaff or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dagger</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a component pouch or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an arcane focus</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a scholar’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A spellbook</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/356/636272696880643718.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/357/636272696881281556.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/11/636336418370446635.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/wizard","spellCastingAbilityId":4,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":112,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":6,"classFeatures":[{"id":328,"name":"Ability Score Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.

When you make an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw and have disadvantage on the roll, you can spend 2 ki points to cancel the disadvantage for that roll.</p>\n\n<p><b>Intoxicated Frenzy</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.SbBdL638SfXTuzGf]{Intoxicated Frenzy}</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to make an overwhelming number of attacks against a group of enemies. When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can make up to three additional attacks with it (up to a total of five Flurry of Blows attacks), provided that each Flurry of Blows attack targets a different creature this turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Martial Arts</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the <a title=\"Weapons\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Weapons\">Weapons</a> section.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong>, <strong>Patient Defense</strong>, and <strong>Step of the Wind</strong>. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Ki save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Flurry of Blows</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Patient Defense</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Step of the Wind</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Monastic Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Deflect Missiles</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slow Fall</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stunning Strike</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki-Empowered Strikes</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">fireball</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stillness of Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Purity of Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages.

You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.</p>\n\n<p><b>Empty Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">astral projection</span> spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Perfect Self</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during your move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Simple weapons, shortswords<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>Choose one type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Strength, Dexterity<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills:</span></strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice:</span></strong> 1d8 per monk level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 76","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ath","his","ins","rel","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":""},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":11,"data":{"id":11,"name":"Monk","description":"<p>A master of martial arts, harnessing the power of the body in pursuit of physical and spiritual perfection</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Dexterity &amp; Wisdom<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Strength &amp; Dexterity</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortsword or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted ParaOverride-7\">10 darts</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/488/636274646181088338.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/489/636274646181411106.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/5/636336417372349522.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/monk","spellCastingAbilityId":null,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":76,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":8,"classFeatures":[{"id":226,"name":"Unarmored Defense","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3},{"id":227,"name":"Martial Arts","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon.

When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside&mdash;at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins&mdash;sometimes called avengers or dark knights&mdash;their own purity is not as important as delive<span class=\"No-Break\">ring justice.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Abjure Enemy. </span></strong>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">On a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Vow of Enmity. </span></strong>As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls&nbsp;unconscious.</p>\n\n<p><b>Relentless Avenger</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.agYNLPRx15yc1U4F]{Relentless Avenger}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.</p>\n\n<p><b>Soul of Vengeance</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.n5A6qIBzyZKWaJBx]{Soul of Vengeance}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.</p>\n\n<p><b>Avenging Angel</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.Z03l9mrWIrJW59sy]{Avenging Angel}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Oath Spells</b></p>\n<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"OathofVengeanceSpells\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude compendium-hr\">Oath of Vengeance Spells</h5>\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Paladin Level</th>\r\n<th>Spells</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>3rd</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>bane, hunter’s mark</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>5th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>hold person, misty step</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>9th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>haste, protection from energy</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>13th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>banishment, dimension door</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>17th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>hold monster, scrying</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\n\n<p><b>Divine Sense</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">hallow</span> spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>\n\n<p><b>Lay on Hands</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level &times; 5.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Paladin)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=4&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the paladin&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Smite</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Health</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sacred Oath</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Oath Spells</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Protection</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Courage</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Improved Divine Smite</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cleansing Touch</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura Improvements</b></p>\n<p>At 18th level, the range of your auras increase to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>All armor, shields<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Simple weapons, martial weapons<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Wisdom, Charisma<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d10 per paladin level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>10 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels: </span></strong>1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per paladin level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 82","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"half"},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":4,"data":{"id":4,"name":"Paladin","description":"<p>A holy warrior bound to a sacred oath</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d10<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Strength &amp; Charisma<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Wisdom &amp; Charisma</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a martial weapon and a shield or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) two martial weapons</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) five javelins or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple melee weapon</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a priest’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Chain mail and a holy symbol</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/364/636272701936950702.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/365/636272701937419552.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/6/636336417477714942.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/paladin","spellCastingAbilityId":6,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":82,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":10,"classFeatures":[{"id":260,"name":"Divine Sense","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Primeval Awareness</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Land’s Stride</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.

You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Vanish</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Senses</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Foe Slayer</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies.

This special attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is radiant, and its damage die is a d4. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you take the Attack action on your turn and use this special attack as part of it, you can spend 1 ki point to make the special attack twice as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain the Extra Attack feature, this special attack can be used for any of the attacks you make as part of the Attack action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Searing Arc Strike</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.XtWNOGYvMSCZ3ifR]{Searing Arc Strike}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your ki into searing waves of energy. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 ki points to cast the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\"><em>burning hands</em></span>&nbsp;spell as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend additional ki points to cast&nbsp;<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\"><em>burning hands</em></span>&nbsp;as a higher-level spell. Each additional ki point you spend increases the spell’s level by 1. The maximum number of ki points (2 plus any additional points) that you can spend on the spell equals half your monk level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Searing Sunburst</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.bI7IXRJN1L96AOn1]{Searing Sunburst}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 11th level, you gain the ability to create an orb of light that erupts into a devastating explosion. As an action, you magically create an orb and hurl it at a point you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly instant.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage. A creature doesn’t need to make the save if the creature is behind total cover that is opaque.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can increase the sphere’s damage by spending ki points. Each point you spend, to a maximum of 3, increases the damage by 2d6.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sun Shield</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.pl5OEL78Et8KfjR7]{Sun Shield}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 17th level, you become wreathed in a luminous, magical aura. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If a creature hits you with a melee attack while this light shines, you can use your reaction to deal radiant damage to the creature. The radiant damage equals 5 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Martial Arts</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the <a title=\"Weapons\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Weapons\">Weapons</a> section.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong>, <strong>Patient Defense</strong>, and <strong>Step of the Wind</strong>. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Ki save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Flurry of Blows</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Patient Defense</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Step of the Wind</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Monastic Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Deflect Missiles</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slow Fall</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stunning Strike</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki-Empowered Strikes</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">fireball</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stillness of Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Purity of Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.</p>\n\n<p><b>Diamond Soul</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.</p>\n\n<p><b>Empty Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">astral projection</span> spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Perfect Self</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during your move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Simple weapons, shortswords<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>Choose one type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Strength, Dexterity<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills:</span></strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice:</span></strong> 1d8 per monk level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 76","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ath","his","ins","rel","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":""},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":11,"data":{"id":11,"name":"Monk","description":"<p>A master of martial arts, harnessing the power of the body in pursuit of physical and spiritual perfection</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Dexterity &amp; Wisdom<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Strength &amp; Dexterity</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortsword or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted ParaOverride-7\">10 darts</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/488/636274646181088338.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/489/636274646181411106.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/5/636336417372349522.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/monk","spellCastingAbilityId":null,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":76,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":8,"classFeatures":[{"id":226,"name":"Unarmored Defense","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3},{"id":227,"name":"Martial Arts","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon.

Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Vanish</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Senses</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Foe Slayer</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies.

At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">beast sense</span> and <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">speak with animals</span> spells, but only as rituals, as described in&nbsp;the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Rituals\" href=\"http://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting#Rituals\">Spellcasting</a></span> section.</p>\n\n<p><b>Totem Spirit</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.ob8RlyffSYFNrUlD]{Totem Spirit}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object &mdash; an amulet or similar adornment &mdash; that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aspect of the Beast</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.jd1tmHxNbP2jZO5g]{Aspect of the Beast}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice.

When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.</p>\n\n<p><b>Totemic Attunement</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.HUQ92xjXc3CTPTMd]{Totemic Attunement}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.</p>\n\n<p><b>Rage</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reckless Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Danger Sense</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Path</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Fast Movement</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Instinct</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Brutal Critical</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Relentless Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Persistent Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Indomitable Might</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Champion</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds.

If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn’t require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Wild Magic Surge</h5>\r\n<table id=\"table016\" class=\"Table TableOverride-1\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\"><strong>d100</strong></p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style-\"><strong>Effect</strong></p>\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-25\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">01&ndash;02</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-20\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">03&ndash;04</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align: left;\">For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-25\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">05&ndash;06</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align: left;\">A modron chosen and controlled by the DM appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-20\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">07&ndash;08</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align: left;\">You cast <span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">fireball</span> as a 3rd-level spell centered on yourself.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">09&ndash;10</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align: left;\">You cast <span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">magic missile</span> as a 5th-level spell.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-26\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">11&ndash;12</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Roll a d10.

Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels&mdash;the perfect servants of good&mdash;as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or c<span class=\"No-Break\">oats of arms.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"Basic-Paragraph\">When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Sacred Weapon. </span></strong>As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Turn the Unholy.</span></strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Devotion</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.t1GgfKZu9LrI0WWb]{Aura of Devotion}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Purity of Spirit</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.oli9QWxgbOOHXIEG]{Purity of Spirit}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">protection from evil and good</span> spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Holy Nimbus</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.60XcEUW5B1exycTT]{Holy Nimbus}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Oath Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Oath of Devotion Spells</h5>\r\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\">\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">Paladin Level</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">Spells</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">3rd</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">protection from evil and good</span>, <span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">sanctuary</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">5th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">lesser restoration</span>, <span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">zone of truth</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">9th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">beacon of hope</span>, <span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">dispel magic</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">13th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">freedom of movement</span>, <span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">guardian of faith</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">17th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">commune</span>, <span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">flame strike</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\n\n<p><b>Divine Sense</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">hallow</span> spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>\n\n<p><b>Lay on Hands</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level &times; 5.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Paladin)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=4&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the paladin&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Smite</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Health</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sacred Oath</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Oath Spells</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Protection</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1).

You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Domain</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for details on all the domains.Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Domain Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each domain has a list of spells &mdash; its domain spells &mdash; that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Destroy Undead</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Destroy Undead Table</h4>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">Cleric Level</p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Destroys Undead of CR ...</p>\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">5th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1/2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">8th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">11th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">14th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">3 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">17th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">4 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Intervention</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action.

To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse. To desecrate the peace of the dead is an abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee Jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish in the world. This is a delay of death, not a denial of it, for death will eventually get its due.</p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Domain Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Grave Domain Spells table.

When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 hit points, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you learn the <em><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">spare the dying</span></em><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\"></span>&nbsp;cantrip, which doesn’t count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet, and you can cast it as a bonus action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Eyes of the Grave</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.Bz5B5UeExTSKp3K3]{Eyes of the Grave}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you gain the ability to occasionally sense the presence of the undead, whose existence is an insult to the natural cycle of life. As an action, you can open your awareness to magically detect undead. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet of you that isn’t behind total cover and that isn’t protected from divination magic. This sense doesn’t tell you anything about a creature’s capabilities or identity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.oiCs7nlWmzBDYdMc]{Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to mark another creature’s life force for termination.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack’s damage, and then the curse ends.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sentinel at Death’s Door</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.Uer1M13srWBLfwkZ]{Sentinel at Death’s Door}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to impede death’s progress. As a reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Potent Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p>\n\n<p><b>Keeper of Souls</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.mSiPhSfrttkPZof9]{Keeper of Souls}</p>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, you can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living. When an enemy you can see dies within 60 feet of you, you or one creature of your choice that is within 60 feet of you regains hit points equal to the enemy’s number of Hit Dice. You can use this feature only if you aren’t incapacitated. Once you use it, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Cleric)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=2&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the cleric spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Domain</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for details on all the domains.Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Domain Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each domain has a list of spells &mdash; its domain spells &mdash; that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Destroy Undead</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Destroy Undead Table</h4>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">Cleric Level</p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Destroys Undead of CR ...</p>\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">5th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1/2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">8th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">11th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">14th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">3 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">17th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">4 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Intervention</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list.

If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spell Slots</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class.

As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit.

See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Recovery</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation&nbsp;is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spell Mastery</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>\n\n<p><b>Signature Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor:</span></strong> None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Intelligence, Wisdom<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d6 per wizard level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>6 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels: </span></strong>1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 112","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"full"},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":8,"data":{"id":8,"name":"Wizard","description":"<p>A scholarly magic-user capable of manipulating the structures of reality</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d6<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong>&nbsp;Intelligence<br /><strong>Saves:</strong>&nbsp;Intelligence &amp; Wisdom</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a quarterstaff or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dagger</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a component pouch or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an arcane focus</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a scholar’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A spellbook</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/356/636272696880643718.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/357/636272696881281556.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/11/636336418370446635.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/wizard","spellCastingAbilityId":4,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":112,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":6,"classFeatures":[{"id":328,"name":"Ability Score Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3},{"id":411,"name":"Arcane Recovery","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook.

Starting at 7th level, the number of mutagens you can create when you finish a rest increases to two, and at 15th level, you can now create three mutagens.</p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action you can consume a single mutagen, and the effects and side effects last until you finish a short or long rest, unless otherwise specified. While one or more mutagens are affecting you, you can use an action to focus and flush the toxins from your system, ending the effects and side effects of all mutagens.</p>\r\n<p>Mutagens are designed for your biology and have no effect on other creatures. They are also unstable by nature, losing their potency over time and becoming inert if not used before you finish your next short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Strange Metabolism</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.Sk4Y56qZ5VfLDEyA]{Strange Metabolism}</p>\n<p>Beginning at 7th level, your body has begun to adapt to toxins and venoms, ignoring their corroding effects.

Any illusions disguising or making a creature invisible when you brand them end, and they can’t benefit from such illusions while branded. If a creature branded by you is polymorphed or has changed shape, they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or revert to their true form and be stunned until the end of your next turn. Whenever a branded creature attempts to polymorph or change shape, they&nbsp;must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or the attempt fails, and they are stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Curse of Corrosion</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.8KxYCKNprzPc2ct0]{Blood Curse of Corrosion}</p>\n<p>Starting at 15th level, your blood curse can wrack a creature’s body with terrible toxins.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as on Intelligence ability checks to recall information about them.</p>\r\n<p>The Hunter’s Bane also empowers your body to control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your abilities. Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hemocraft save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Maledict</b></p>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel, and sometimes sacrifice, a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate creatures through hemocraft magic.

While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by losing a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse’s description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are immune to blood curses, unless you have amplified the curse.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Blood Maledict feature twice, at 13th level you can use it three times between rests, and at 17th level, you can use it four times between rests. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.

When you activate a rite, you lose a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table.</p>\r\n<p>For the duration, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen rite’s type. This damage is magical, and increases as you gain levels as a blood hunter, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. A weapon can only hold a single active rite at a time.</p>\r\n<p>You learn an additional Primal Rite at 7th level, and access to an Esoteric Rite at 14th level.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"PrimalRites\">Primal Rites</h4>\r\n<p>Choose from the following:</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Flame.</strong></em> Your rite damage is fire damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Frozen.</strong></em> Your rite damage is cold damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Storm.</strong></em> Your rite damage is lightning damage.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"EsotericRites\">Esoteric Rites</h4>\r\n<p>Choose from the following:</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Dead.</strong></em> Your rite damage is necrotic damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Oracle.</strong></em> Your rite damage is psychic damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Roar.</strong></em> Your rite damage is thunder damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Hunter Order</b></p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you commit to an order of blood hunter martial focus.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Brand of Castigation</b></p>\n<p>At 6th level, whenever you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite feature, you can choose to sear an arcane brand of hemocraft magic into it (requires no action). You always know the direction to the branded creature, and each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the creature takes psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 damage).</p>\r\n<p>Your brand lasts until you dismiss it, or you apply a brand to another creature. Your brand counts as a spell for the purposes of dispel magic, and the spell level is equal to half of your blood hunter level (maximum of 9th level spell).</p>\r\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Grim Psychometry</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 9th level, you have a supernatural talent for discerning the history surrounding mysterious objects or places touched by evil. When making an Intelligence (History) check to recall information about a darker past surrounding an object you are touching, or a location you are present in, you have advantage on the roll. The information gleaned often leans towards the more sinister influences of the past, and sometimes conveys&nbsp;visions of things previously unknown to the character on higher rolls.</p>\n\n<p><b>Dark Augmentation</b></p>\n<p>Upon reaching 10th level, arcane blood magic suffuses your body, permanently reinforcing your resilience. Your speed increases by 5 feet, and whenever you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\n\n<p><b>Brand of Tethering</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 13th level, the psychic damage from your Brand of Castigation increases to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2 damage).</p>\r\n<p>In addition, a branded creature can’t take the Dash action, and if a creature branded by you attempts to teleport or leave their current plane via ability, spell, or portal, they take 4d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the teleport or plane shift fails.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hardened Soul</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sanguine Mastery</b></p>\n<p>Upon becoming 20th level, you hone your control over blood magic, mitigating your sacrifice and empowering your capability. Once per turn, whenever a blood hunter feature requires you to roll a hemocraft die, you can choose to reroll the die and choose which result to use.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon attack empowered by your Crimson Rite, you regain one expended use of your Blood Maledict feature.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Curses</b></p>\n<p>The blood curses are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheAnxious\">Blood Curse of the Anxious</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you magnify the adrenaline in the body of a creature within 30 feet of you, making them susceptible to forceful influence.

At the end of each of its turns, the cursed creature can make another Strength saving throw. On a success, this curse ends.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofBloatedAgony\">Blood Curse of Bloated Agony</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you curse a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you to painfully swell until the end of your next turn.

Until the end of the turn, the target loses resistance to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Amplify.</strong></em> The target instead loses invulnerability to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell, having resistance to them until the end of the turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheEyeless\">Blood Curse of the Eyeless</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll one hemocraft die and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s attack roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature’s roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll succeeds. The creature is immune if it is immune to blindness.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> You apply this curse to all of the creature’s attack rolls until the end of the turn. You roll a new hemocraft die for each affected attack.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheFallenPuppet\">Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you drops to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to give that creature a final act of aggression.

Many spies, courtiers, and schemers follow this archetype, leading lives of intrigue. Words are your weapons as often as knives or poison, and secrets and&nbsp;favors&nbsp;are some of your&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;treasures.</p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Master of Intrigue</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.AACJdMM56kmzXKC7]{Master of Intrigue}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, and one gaming set of your choice. You also learn two languages of your choice.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, enabling you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language.</p>\n\n<p><b>Master of Tactics</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.zquJ0qknGOB9Cchk]{Master of Tactics}</p>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the&nbsp;Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Insightful Manipulator</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.NUlf8boyLuMKuRUy]{Insightful Manipulator}</p>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Intelligence score</li>\r\n<li>Wisdom score</li>\r\n<li>Charisma score</li>\r\n<li>Class levels (if any)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>At the DM’s option, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature’s history or one of its personality traits, if it has any.</p>\n\n<p><b>Misdirection</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.MT2IfFXvfShmtICw]{Misdirection}</p>\n<p>Beginning at 13th level, you can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When you are targeted by an attack while a creature within 5 feet of you is granting you cover against that attack, you can use your reaction to have the attack target that creature instead of you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Soul of Deceit</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.2iXfziK2zcufeiHI]{Soul of Deceit}</p>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, your thoughts can’t be read by telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts by succeeding on a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the mind reader’s Wisdom (Insight) check.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful if you so choose, and you can’t be compelled to tell the truth by magic.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Expertise</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sneak Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>\n\n<p><b>Thieves’ Cant</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cunning Action</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or&nbsp;Hide action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Roguish Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Uncanny Dodge</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">ice storm</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reliable Talent</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blindsense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slippery Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n\n<p><b>Elusive</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you.

This does not count against your number of blood curses known.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong>&nbsp;1d10 per blood hunter&nbsp;level<br /><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong>&nbsp;10 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong>&nbsp;1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per blood hunter level after 1st</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong>Armor:</strong>&nbsp;Light armor, medium armor, shields<br /><strong>Weapons:</strong>&nbsp;Simple weapons, martial weapons<br /><strong>Tools:</strong>&nbsp;Alchemist’s supplies<br /><strong>Saving Throws:</strong>&nbsp;Dexterity, Intelligence<br /><strong>Skills:</strong>&nbsp;Choose three from Athletics, Acrobatics, Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Religion, and Survival</p>\n\n<p><b>Hunter's Bane</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, you have survived the Hunter’s Bane, a dangerous, long-guarded ritual that alters your life’s blood, forever binding you to the darkness and honing your senses against it. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as on Intelligence ability checks to recall information about them.</p>\r\n<p>The Hunter’s Bane also empowers your body to control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your abilities. Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hemocraft save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Maledict</b></p>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel, and sometimes sacrifice, a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate creatures through hemocraft magic. You gain one blood curse of your choice, detailed in the &ldquo;<a title=\"Blood Curses\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/blood-hunter#BloodCurses-1611383\">Blood Curses</a>&rdquo; section at the end of the class description. You learn one additional blood curse of your choice, and you can choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse, at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>\r\n<p>When you use your Blood Maledict, you choose which curse to invoke. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by losing a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse’s description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are immune to blood curses, unless you have amplified the curse.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Blood Maledict feature twice, at 13th level you can use it three times between rests, and at 17th level, you can use it four times between rests. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Crimson Rite</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you learn to invoke a rite of hemocraft within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose one rite from the Primal Rites list below to learn.</p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can activate a crimson rite on a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite of your choice that lasts until you finish a short or long rest, or if you aren’t holding the weapon at the end of your turn. When you activate a rite, you lose a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table.</p>\r\n<p>For the duration, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen rite’s type. This damage is magical, and increases as you gain levels as a blood hunter, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. A weapon can only hold a single active rite at a time.</p>\r\n<p>You learn an additional Primal Rite at 7th level, and access to an Esoteric Rite at 14th level.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"PrimalRites\">Primal Rites</h4>\r\n<p>Choose from the following:</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Flame.</strong></em> Your rite damage is fire damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Frozen.</strong></em> Your rite damage is cold damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Storm.</strong></em> Your rite damage is lightning damage.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"EsotericRites\">Esoteric Rites</h4>\r\n<p>Choose from the following:</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Dead.</strong></em> Your rite damage is necrotic damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Oracle.</strong></em> Your rite damage is psychic damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Roar.</strong></em> Your rite damage is thunder damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Hunter Order</b></p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you commit to an order of blood hunter martial focus. Choose Order of the Ghostslayer, Order of the Profane Soul, Order of the Mutant, or Order of the Lycan, all detailed at the end of the class description. The order you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Brand of Castigation</b></p>\n<p>At 6th level, whenever you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite feature, you can choose to sear an arcane brand of hemocraft magic into it (requires no action). You always know the direction to the branded creature, and each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the creature takes psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 damage).</p>\r\n<p>Your brand lasts until you dismiss it, or you apply a brand to another creature. Your brand counts as a spell for the purposes of dispel magic, and the spell level is equal to half of your blood hunter level (maximum of 9th level spell).</p>\r\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Grim Psychometry</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 9th level, you have a supernatural talent for discerning the history surrounding mysterious objects or places touched by evil. When making an Intelligence (History) check to recall information about a darker past surrounding an object you are touching, or a location you are present in, you have advantage on the roll. The information gleaned often leans towards the more sinister influences of the past, and sometimes conveys&nbsp;visions of things previously unknown to the character on higher rolls.</p>\n\n<p><b>Dark Augmentation</b></p>\n<p>Upon reaching 10th level, arcane blood magic suffuses your body, permanently reinforcing your resilience. Your speed increases by 5 feet, and whenever you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\n\n<p><b>Brand of Tethering</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 13th level, the psychic damage from your Brand of Castigation increases to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2 damage).</p>\r\n<p>In addition, a branded creature can’t take the Dash action, and if a creature branded by you attempts to teleport or leave their current plane via ability, spell, or portal, they take 4d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the teleport or plane shift fails.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hardened Soul</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sanguine Mastery</b></p>\n<p>Upon becoming 20th level, you hone your control over blood magic, mitigating your sacrifice and empowering your capability. Once per turn, whenever a blood hunter feature requires you to roll a hemocraft die, you can choose to reroll the die and choose which result to use.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon attack empowered by your Crimson Rite, you regain one expended use of your Blood Maledict feature.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Curses</b></p>\n<p>The blood curses are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheAnxious\">Blood Curse of the Anxious</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you magnify the adrenaline in the body of a creature within 30 feet of you, making them susceptible to forceful influence. Until the end of your next turn, all creatures have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks directed at the target creature.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Amplify.</strong></em> The next Wisdom saving throw the target makes before this curse ends has disadvantage. Once you’ve amplified this blood curse, you must finish a long rest before you can amplify it again.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofBinding\">Blood Curse of Binding</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can attempt to bind a creature you can see within 30 feet of you that is no more than one size larger than you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have their speed be reduced to 0 and they can’t use reactions until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> This curse lasts for 1 minute and can affect a creature regardless of their size. At the end of each of its turns, the cursed creature can make another Strength saving throw. On a success, this curse ends.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofBloatedAgony\">Blood Curse of Bloated Agony</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you curse a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you to painfully swell until the end of your next turn. For the duration of this curse, the creature has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks, and suffers 1d8 necrotic damage if it makes more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> This curse lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the cursed creature can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, this curse ends.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofCorrosion\">Blood Curse of Corrosion</h5>\r\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 15th level, Order of the Mutant</em></p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, a creature within 30 feet of you becomes poisoned. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the curse ends.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The cursed creature suffers 4d6 necrotic damage, and suffers this damage again every time it fails its Constitution saving throw to end this curse at the end of its turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheExorcist\">Blood Curse of the Exorcist</h5>\r\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 15th level, Order of the Ghostslayer</em></p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you that is charmed, frightened, or possessed. The target creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The creature that charmed, frightened, or possessed the target of your curse suffers 3d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofExposure\">Blood Curse of Exposure</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet is hit by an attack or spell, you can use your reaction to temporarily weaken their resilience against it. Until the end of the turn, the target loses resistance to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Amplify.</strong></em> The target instead loses invulnerability to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell, having resistance to them until the end of the turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheEyeless\">Blood Curse of the Eyeless</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll one hemocraft die and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s attack roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature’s roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll succeeds. The creature is immune if it is immune to blindness.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> You apply this curse to all of the creature’s attack rolls until the end of the turn. You roll a new hemocraft die for each affected attack.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheFallenPuppet\">Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you drops to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to give that creature a final act of aggression. That creature immediately makes a single weapon attack against a target of your choice within its attack range.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> You can first move the cursed creature up to half their speed, and you grant a bonus to the cursed creature’s attack roll equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheHowl\">Blood Curse of the Howl</h5>\r\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 18th level, Order of the Lycan</em></p>\r\n<p>As an action, you unleash a blood-curdling howl. Each creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. If they fail their saving throw by 5 or more, they are stunned while frightened in this way. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this blood curse for the next 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the howl.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Amplify.</strong></em> The range of this curse increases to 60 feet.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheMarked\">Blood Curse of the Marked</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can mark a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. Until the end of your turn, whenever you deal rite damage to the target, you roll an additional hemocraft die of rite damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn has advantage.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheMuddledMind\">Blood Curse of the Muddled Mind</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you curse a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you that is concentrating on a spell. That creature has disadvantage on the next Constitution saving throw it must make to maintain concentration before the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The cursed creature has disadvantage on all Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration of spells until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheSouleater\">Blood Curse of the Souleater</h5>\r\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 18th level, Order of the Profane Soul</em></p>\r\n<p>When a creature that isn’t a construct or undead is reduced to 0 hit points within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to usher their soul to your patron in exchange for power.

These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk.

During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Circle Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells.

Choose that land &mdash; arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark &mdash; and consult the associated list of spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Nature’s Ward</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Nature’s Sanctuary</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druidic</b></p>\n<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Druid)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=3&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the druid&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druid Circle</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p>\n\n<p><b>Beast Spells</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.</p>\n\n<p><b>Archdruid</b></p>\n<p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":4},{"id":167,"name":"Wild Shape","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>","requiredLevel":2,"displayOrder":5},{"id":168,"name":"Wild Shape Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed.

When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using a kensei weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon’s type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><em><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Way of the Brush.</span></strong></em> You gain proficiency with your choice of calligrapher’s supplies or painter’s supplies.</p>\n\n<p><b>One with the Blade</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.YKOgOtbACi1O43bE]{One with the Blade}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you extend your ki into your kensei weapons, granting you the following benefits.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><em><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Magic Kensei Weapons.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;Your attacks with your kensei weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><em><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Deft Strike.</span></strong></em> When you hit a target with a kensei weapon, you can spend 1 ki point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die.

This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the <a title=\"Weapons\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Weapons\">Weapons</a> section.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong>, <strong>Patient Defense</strong>, and <strong>Step of the Wind</strong>. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Ki save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Flurry of Blows</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Patient Defense</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Step of the Wind</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Monastic Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Deflect Missiles</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slow Fall</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stunning Strike</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki-Empowered Strikes</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">fireball</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stillness of Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Purity of Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.</p>\n\n<p><b>Diamond Soul</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.</p>\n\n<p><b>Empty Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">astral projection</span> spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Perfect Self</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during your move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Simple weapons, shortswords<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>Choose one type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Strength, Dexterity<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills:</span></strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice:</span></strong> 1d8 per monk level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 76","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ath","his","ins","rel","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":""},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":11,"data":{"id":11,"name":"Monk","description":"<p>A master of martial arts, harnessing the power of the body in pursuit of physical and spiritual perfection</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Dexterity &amp; Wisdom<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Strength &amp; Dexterity</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortsword or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted ParaOverride-7\">10 darts</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/488/636274646181088338.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/489/636274646181411106.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/5/636336417372349522.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/monk","spellCastingAbilityId":null,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":76,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":8,"classFeatures":[{"id":226,"name":"Unarmored Defense","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3},{"id":227,"name":"Martial Arts","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon.

See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Recovery</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.Einp5DnEFLcWnIF5]{Arcane Recovery}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Tradition</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.1Qz4JyUnuStAozu7]{Arcane Tradition}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation&nbsp;is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spell Mastery</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.DHYyWAYb20BEGCND]{Spell Mastery}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>\n\n<p><b>Signature Spells</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.hqKM4rObmYyamgwq]{Signature Spells}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor:</span></strong> None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Intelligence, Wisdom<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d6 per wizard level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>6 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels: </span></strong>1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 112","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"full"},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":8,"data":{"id":8,"name":"Wizard","description":"<p>A scholarly magic-user capable of manipulating the structures of reality</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d6<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong>&nbsp;Intelligence<br /><strong>Saves:</strong>&nbsp;Intelligence &amp; Wisdom</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a quarterstaff or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dagger</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a component pouch or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an arcane focus</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a scholar’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A spellbook</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/356/636272696880643718.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/357/636272696881281556.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/11/636336418370446635.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/wizard","spellCastingAbilityId":4,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":112,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":6,"classFeatures":[{"id":328,"name":"Ability Score Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3},{"id":411,"name":"Arcane Recovery","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook.

nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Nature’s Ward</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Nature’s Sanctuary</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druidic</b></p>\n<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Druid)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=3&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the druid&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druid Circle</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p>\n\n<p><b>Beast Spells</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.</p>\n\n<p><b>Archdruid</b></p>\n<p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":4},{"id":167,"name":"Wild Shape","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>","requiredLevel":2,"displayOrder":5},{"id":168,"name":"Wild Shape Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed.

Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you mark them as analyzed. Whenever an analyzed creature misses you with an attack, you can immediately use your reaction to make an unarmed melee attack against that creature. This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, you learn the following attributes about the target: Damage Vulnerabilities, Damage Resistances, Damage Immunities, and Condition Immunities.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extort Truth</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.0ZxSFBRicsK9butw]{Extort Truth}</p>\n<p>At 6th level, you can hit a hidden cluster of nerves on a creature with precision, temporarily causing them to become mentally malleable. If you hit a creature with an unarmed attack, you can spend 1 ki point to force them to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is unable to speak a deliberate lie and all Charisma checks directed at the creature are made with advantage for up to 10 minutes. You know if they succeeded or failed on their saving throw.</p>\r\n<p>An affected creature is aware of the effect and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as the effect lasts.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mind of Mercury</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.nMg0f5kIiK6IGySl]{Mind of Mercury}</p>\n<p>Starting at 11th level, you’ve honed your awareness and reflexes through mental aptitude and pattern recognition. Once per turn, if you’ve already taken your reaction, you may spend 1 ki point to take an additional reaction.</p>\n\n<p><b>Debilitating Barrage</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.30VBwFas7mfwzShE]{Debilitating Barrage}</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 17th level, you’ve gained the knowledge to temporarily lower a creature’s fortitude by striking a series of pressure points. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can spend 3 ki points to cause the creature to suffer a vulnerability to a damage type of your choice for 1 minute, or until they take damage of that type. A creature who is affected by this feature cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mystical Erudition (Additional)</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.eDYSuGLhSTu9qGVD]{Mystical Erudition (Additional)}</p>\n<p>You gain an additional language and an additional skill proficiency from the above list at 11th level.

This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the <a title=\"Weapons\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Weapons\">Weapons</a> section.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong>, <strong>Patient Defense</strong>, and <strong>Step of the Wind</strong>. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Ki save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Flurry of Blows</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Patient Defense</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Step of the Wind</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Monastic Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Deflect Missiles</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slow Fall</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stunning Strike</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki-Empowered Strikes</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">fireball</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stillness of Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Purity of Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.</p>\n\n<p><b>Diamond Soul</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.</p>\n\n<p><b>Empty Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">astral projection</span> spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Perfect Self</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during your move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Simple weapons, shortswords<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>Choose one type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Strength, Dexterity<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills:</span></strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice:</span></strong> 1d8 per monk level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 76","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ath","his","ins","rel","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":""},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":11,"data":{"id":11,"name":"Monk","description":"<p>A master of martial arts, harnessing the power of the body in pursuit of physical and spiritual perfection</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Dexterity &amp; Wisdom<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Strength &amp; Dexterity</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortsword or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted ParaOverride-7\">10 darts</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/488/636274646181088338.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/489/636274646181411106.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/5/636336417372349522.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/monk","spellCastingAbilityId":null,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":76,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":8,"classFeatures":[{"id":226,"name":"Unarmored Defense","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3},{"id":227,"name":"Martial Arts","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon.

In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors’ deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.</p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Ancestral Protectors</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.XeKuGlACxCCtsagT]{Ancestral Protectors}</p>\n<p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn’t against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spirit Shield</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.L1MurGGx6OcB4wX9]{Spirit Shield}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, the guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. If you are raging and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach certain levels in this class, you can reduce the damage by more: by 3d6 at 10th level and by 4d6 at 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Consult the Spirits</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.3QXgUSgGV0tknC9m]{Consult the Spirits}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the&nbsp;<em><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">augury</span></em><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\"></span><em>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\"><em>clairvoyance</em></span>&nbsp;spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of&nbsp;<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\"><em>clairvoyance</em></span>&nbsp;invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you cast either spell in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Vengeful Ancestors</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.gDuKkRUFRtg9YXe5]{Vengeful Ancestors}</p>\n<p>At 14th level, your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage equal to the damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.</p>\n\n<p><b>Rage</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reckless Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Danger Sense</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Path</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. The Path of the Berserker is detailed at the end of the class description, and additional primal paths are available in other sources. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Fast Movement</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Instinct</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Brutal Critical</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Relentless Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Persistent Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Indomitable Might</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Champion</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds.

They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect th<span class=\"No-Break\">em from harm.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Open Hand Technique</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.VxblQmfJOjQx52eP]{Open Hand Technique}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Wholeness of Body</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.3pY6LvSAce3TpvnB]{Wholeness of Body}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tranquility</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.nSUrPKxqvtBMb69w]{Tranquility}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">sanctuary</span> spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p>\n\n<p><b>Quivering Palm</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.5hwRB4HKcElgwcy3]{Quivering Palm}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Martial Arts</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the <a title=\"Weapons\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Weapons\">Weapons</a> section.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong>, <strong>Patient Defense</strong>, and <strong>Step of the Wind</strong>. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Ki save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Flurry of Blows</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Patient Defense</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Step of the Wind</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Monastic Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Deflect Missiles</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slow Fall</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stunning Strike</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki-Empowered Strikes</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">fireball</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stillness of Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Purity of Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.</p>\n\n<p><b>Diamond Soul</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.</p>\n\n<p><b>Empty Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">astral projection</span> spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Perfect Self</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during your move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Simple weapons, shortswords<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>Choose one type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Strength, Dexterity<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills:</span></strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice:</span></strong> 1d8 per monk level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 76","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ath","his","ins","rel","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":""},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":11,"data":{"id":11,"name":"Monk","description":"<p>A master of martial arts, harnessing the power of the body in pursuit of physical and spiritual perfection</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Dexterity &amp; Wisdom<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Strength &amp; Dexterity</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortsword or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted ParaOverride-7\">10 darts</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/488/636274646181088338.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/489/636274646181411106.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/5/636336417372349522.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/monk","spellCastingAbilityId":null,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":76,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":8,"classFeatures":[{"id":226,"name":"Unarmored Defense","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3},{"id":227,"name":"Martial Arts","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon.

See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Cleric)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=2&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the cleric spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Domain</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for details on all the domains.Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Domain Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each domain has a list of spells &mdash; its domain spells &mdash; that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests.

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list.

The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s myst<span class=\"No-Break\">erious rites.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Bonus Cantrip</b></p>\n<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.</p>\n\n<p><b>Natural Recovery</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Circle Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land &mdash; arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark &mdash; and consult the associated list of spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Arctic</h5>\r\n<table

When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses.

See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Druid)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=3&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the druid&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druid Circle</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly.

To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n\n<p><b>Ranger Archetype</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.dzS1dybpQQDFgi9j]{Ranger Archetype}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: the Hunter that is detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Primeval Awareness</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.ldoUX7tK1M9dKgvr]{Primeval Awareness}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Land’s Stride</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.KJg26RM9YLAKQvX8]{Land’s Stride}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">entangle</span> spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.h9Bm5DPMpKoIs73i]{Hide in Plain Sight}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Vanish</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.NnGPWYWWcrHV86k7]{Vanish}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn.

When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Foe Slayer</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.zAuURTjkGQbKLJPC]{Foe Slayer}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies.

The target is frightened in this way for 1&nbsp;hour,&nbsp;until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mantle of Whispers</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.qNXyDw6qDKQHMOes]{Mantle of Whispers}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to adopt a humanoid’s persona. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. You retain this shadow until you use it or you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">While you’re in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal&nbsp;life,&nbsp;but doesn’t include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus to your check.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can’t capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Shadow Lore</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.mePB48uq2h2WbN52]{Shadow Lore}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 14th level, you gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a creature’s deepest fears.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn’t share a language with you or if it can’t hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">On a failed saving throw, the target is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack it, damage it, or force it to make a saving throw. It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain no knowledge of this secret, but the target is convinced you know it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The charmed creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won’t risk its life for you or fight for&nbsp;you,&nbsp;unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors&nbsp;and gifts it would offer to a close friend.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music.

You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spell Slots</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</span></p>\r\n<p><b>Spell save DC </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\r\n<p><b>Spell attack modifier </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Ritual Casting</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Focus</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use a musical instrument (see the <a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Tools\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tools</span></a> section) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bardic Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class.

If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bard College</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore detailed at the end of the class description or another from the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Player's Handbook</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or other sources.

You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Domain</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.iO9Bt0YuVAI34Egz]{Divine Domain}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for details on all the domains.Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Domain Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each domain has a list of spells &mdash; its domain spells &mdash; that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Destroy Undead</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.8Pud6MscUOHdWxYn]{Destroy Undead}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Destroy Undead Table</h4>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">Cleric Level</p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Destroys Undead of CR ...</p>\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">5th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1/2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">8th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">11th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">14th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">3 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">17th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">4 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Intervention</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.19OYxXgXSAC1v7yp]{Divine Intervention}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days.

See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Recovery</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation&nbsp;is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spell Mastery</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>\n\n<p><b>Signature Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor:</span></strong> None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Intelligence, Wisdom<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d6 per wizard level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>6 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels: </span></strong>1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 112","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"full"},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":8,"data":{"id":8,"name":"Wizard","description":"<p>A scholarly magic-user capable of manipulating the structures of reality</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d6<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong>&nbsp;Intelligence<br /><strong>Saves:</strong>&nbsp;Intelligence &amp; Wisdom</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a quarterstaff or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dagger</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a component pouch or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an arcane focus</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a scholar’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A spellbook</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/356/636272696880643718.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/357/636272696881281556.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/11/636336418370446635.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/wizard","spellCastingAbilityId":4,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":112,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":6,"classFeatures":[{"id":328,"name":"Ability Score Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes.

To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Health</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.9nWd3KrQbxHfmX4P]{Divine Health}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sacred Oath</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.mboJdxWeFTXKoH8R]{Sacred Oath}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever.

Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use.

United in focus, beast and ranger fight the monsters that threaten civilization and the wild<span class=\"No-Break\">erness alike.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Ranger’s Companion</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.hOh9NkLqWyIefvnw]{Ranger’s Companion}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action. If you don't issue a command, the beast takes the Dodge action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The beast never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If the beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 8 hours magically bonding with a beast that isn’t hostile to you and that meets the requirements.</p>\n\n<p><b>Exceptional Training</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.hQ3HB43XfYgTrABO]{Exceptional Training}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns when your beast companion doesn’t attack, you can use a bonus action to command the beast to take the Dash, Disengage, or Help action on its turn.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, the beast's attacks now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Bestial Fury</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.W6J6f2BV5jVjZzwj]{Bestial Fury}</p>\n<p>Starting at 11th level, when you command your beast companion to take the Attack action, the beast can make two attacks, or it can take the Multiattack action if it has that action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Share Spells</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.Kgvdy1Ng9Jx9qlww]{Share Spells}</p>\n<p>Beginning at 15th level, when you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Favored Enemy</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.</p>\n\n<p><b>Natural Explorer</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Ranger)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=5&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the ranger spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spell Slots</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> using either slot.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n\n<p><b>Ranger Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: the Hunter that is detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Primeval Awareness</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Land’s Stride</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">entangle</span> spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Vanish</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Senses</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Foe Slayer</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>Light armor, medium armor, shields<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Simple weapons, martial weapons<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Strength, Dexterity<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d10 per ranger level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>10 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per ranger level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 89","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["ath","ins","inv","nat","prc","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"half"},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":5,"data":{"id":5,"name":"Ranger","description":"<p>A warrior who combats threats on the edges of civilization</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d10<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong>&nbsp;Dexterity &amp; Wisdom<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Strength &amp;&nbsp;Dexterity</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) scale mail or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) leather armor</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) two shortswords or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) two simple melee weapons</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/366/636272702825813090.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/367/636272702826438096.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/7/636336417569697438.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/ranger","spellCastingAbilityId":5,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":89,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":10,"classFeatures":[{"id":294,"name":"Favored Enemy","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> using either slot.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves’ guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of th<span class=\"No-Break\">eir students.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Shadow Arts</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.VaD0Q6N0xmfsAxvB]{Shadow Arts}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">darkness</span>, <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">darkvision</span>, <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">pass without trace</span>, or <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">silence</span>, without providing material components. Additionally, you gain the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">minor illusion</span> cantrip if you don’t already know it.</p>\n\n<p><b>Shadow Step</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.dHlZP7RiajpTGgkT]{Shadow Step}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cloak of Shadows</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.8cutHXenbwknTab2]{Cloak of Shadows}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 11th level, you have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a spell, or are in an area of bright light.</p>\n\n<p><b>Opportunist</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.PjQs9pRLVVbCfI8g]{Opportunist}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 17th level, you can exploit a creature’s momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Martial Arts</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the <a title=\"Weapons\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Weapons\">Weapons</a> section.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong>, <strong>Patient Defense</strong>, and <strong>Step of the Wind</strong>. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Ki save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Flurry of Blows</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Patient Defense</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Step of the Wind</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Monastic Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Deflect Missiles</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slow Fall</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stunning Strike</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki-Empowered Strikes</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">fireball</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stillness of Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Purity of Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.</p>\n\n<p><b>Diamond Soul</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however.

Those who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers, spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed priests trained to exterminate the enemies of their deity. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your foes with deadl<span class=\"No-Break\">y efficiency.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner’s kit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Assassinate</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.JE19nSAS4czdp2FX]{Assassinate}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Infiltration Expertise</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.W5SRGSQuxa9VU8h0]{Infiltration Expertise}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can’t establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.</p>\n\n<p><b>Impostor</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.LIufZFgOTZ6Sbtiq]{Impostor}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person’s speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of the person’s behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.</p>\n\n<p><b>Death Strike</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.lkbOM7lsZX7jAvtq]{Death Strike}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Expertise</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sneak Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>\n\n<p><b>Thieves’ Cant</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cunning Action</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or&nbsp;Hide action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Roguish Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Uncanny Dodge</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">ice storm</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reliable Talent</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blindsense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slippery Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n\n<p><b>Elusive</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you.

These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk.

During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Circle Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells.

Choose that land &mdash; arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark &mdash; and consult the associated list of spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Nature’s Ward</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Nature’s Sanctuary</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druidic</b></p>\n<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Druid)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=3&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the druid&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>","requiredLevel":2,"displayOrder":5},{"id":168,"name":"Wild Shape Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed.

You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Circle Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land &mdash; arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark &mdash; and consult the associated list of spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Arctic</h5>\r\n<table

nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Nature’s Ward</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Nature’s Sanctuary</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druidic</b></p>\n<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids.

See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Druid)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=3&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the druid&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druid Circle</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly.

To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the eleme<span class=\"No-Break\">nts together.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cr<span class=\"No-Break\">esting waves.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Disciple of the Elements</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.yu5eLcV776RXjagy]{Disciple of the Elements}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other elemental discipline of your choice, which are detailed in the &ldquo;Elemental Disciplines&rdquo; section below. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Casting Elemental Spells</span></h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a></span> section&nbsp;for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don’t need to provide material components for it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">burning hands</span> does. The spell’s level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">burning hands</span>, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline’s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Spells and Ki Points</h5>\r\n<table id=\"table010\" class=\"Table TableOverride-3\"><colgroup></colgroup>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\"><strong>Monk Levels</strong></p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\"><strong>Maximum Ki Points for a Spell</strong></p>\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">5th&ndash;8th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">3</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">9th&ndash;12th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">4</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">13th&ndash;16th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">5</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">17th&ndash;20th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">6</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\n\n<p><b>Elemental Disciplines</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.yf290XduUgs52ThU]{Elemental Disciplines}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">The elemental disciplines are presented in alphabetical order. If a discipline requires a level, you must be that level in this class to learn the discipline.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Martial Arts</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the <a title=\"Weapons\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Weapons\">Weapons</a> section.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong>, <strong>Patient Defense</strong>, and <strong>Step of the Wind</strong>. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Ki save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Flurry of Blows</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Patient Defense</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Step of the Wind</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Monastic Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Deflect Missiles</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slow Fall</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stunning Strike</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki-Empowered Strikes</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">fireball</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stillness of Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Purity of Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.</p>\n\n<p><b>Diamond Soul</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.</p>\n\n<p><b>Empty Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">astral projection</span> spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Perfect Self</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during your move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Simple weapons, shortswords<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>Choose one type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Strength, Dexterity<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills:</span></strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice:</span></strong> 1d8 per monk level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 76","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ath","his","ins","rel","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":""},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":11,"data":{"id":11,"name":"Monk","description":"<p>A master of martial arts, harnessing the power of the body in pursuit of physical and spiritual perfection</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Dexterity &amp; Wisdom<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Strength &amp; Dexterity</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortsword or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted ParaOverride-7\">10 darts</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/488/636274646181088338.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/489/636274646181411106.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/5/636336417372349522.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/monk","spellCastingAbilityId":null,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":76,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":8,"classFeatures":[{"id":226,"name":"Unarmored Defense","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3},{"id":227,"name":"Martial Arts","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon.

The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that empower a caster’s spells, while also providing methods for wizards to bolster their own defenses.</p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Deflection</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.gJ5zXhrCHJVgvKQX]{Arcane Deflection}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you have learned to weave your magic to fortify yourself against harm. When you are hit by an attack or you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a +2 bonus to your AC against that attack or a +4 bonus to that saving throw.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use this feature, you can’t cast spells other than cantrips until the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tactical Wit</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.6NuhKwCEtgVMMcWe]{Tactical Wit}</p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, your keen ability to assess tactical situations allows you to act quickly in battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Power Surge</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.EhT952sEn0oqJ1ev]{Power Surge}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 6th level, you can store magical energy within yourself to later empower your damaging spells. In its stored form, this energy is called a power surge.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end a spell with <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">dispel magic</span>&nbsp;or <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">counterspell</span>, you gain one power surge, as you steal magic from the spell you foiled. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature or object with a wizard spell, you can spend one power surge to deal extra force damage to that target. The extra damage equals half your wizard level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Durable Magic</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.qGxjZ41LImAW2aym]{Durable Magic}</p>\n<p>Beginning at 10th level, the magic you channel helps ward off harm. While you maintain concentration on a spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws.</p>\n\n<p><b>Deflecting Shroud</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.YIWDzRVvHhkHDeVD]{Deflecting Shroud}</p>\n<p>At 14th level, your Arcane Deflection becomes infused with deadly magic. When you use your Arcane Deflection feature, you can cause magical energy to arc from you. Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you each take [rule]force damage[/rule] equal to half your wizard level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Recovery</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation&nbsp;is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spell Mastery</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>\n\n<p><b>Signature Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor:</span></strong> None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Intelligence, Wisdom<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d6 per wizard level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>6 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels: </span></strong>1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 112","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"full"},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":8,"data":{"id":8,"name":"Wizard","description":"<p>A scholarly magic-user capable of manipulating the structures of reality</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d6<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong>&nbsp;Intelligence<br /><strong>Saves:</strong>&nbsp;Intelligence &amp; Wisdom</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a quarterstaff or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dagger</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a component pouch or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an arcane focus</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a scholar’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A spellbook</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/356/636272696880643718.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/357/636272696881281556.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/11/636336418370446635.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/wizard","spellCastingAbilityId":4,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":112,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":6,"classFeatures":[{"id":328,"name":"Ability Score Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</p>\n\n<p><b>Potent Cantrip</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.gHSOpYeWanhp4pqt]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p>\n\n<p><b>Empowered Evocation</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.i6N5QE9nKZ9m8r6D]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.</p>\n\n<p><b>Overchannel</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.sDIroRFkKHSJptuL]{Overchannel}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.

See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3},{"id":411,"name":"Arcane Recovery","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook.

This does not count against your number of blood curses known.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong>&nbsp;1d10 per blood hunter&nbsp;level<br /><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong>&nbsp;10 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong>&nbsp;1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per blood hunter level after 1st</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong>Armor:</strong>&nbsp;Light armor, medium armor, shields<br /><strong>Weapons:</strong>&nbsp;Simple weapons, martial weapons<br /><strong>Tools:</strong>&nbsp;Alchemist’s supplies<br /><strong>Saving Throws:</strong>&nbsp;Dexterity, Intelligence<br /><strong>Skills:</strong>&nbsp;Choose three from Athletics, Acrobatics, Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Religion, and Survival</p>\n\n<p><b>Hunter's Bane</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, you have survived the Hunter’s Bane, a dangerous, long-guarded ritual that alters your life’s blood, forever binding you to the darkness and honing your senses against it. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as on Intelligence ability checks to recall information about them.</p>\r\n<p>The Hunter’s Bane also empowers your body to control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your abilities. Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hemocraft save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Maledict</b></p>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel, and sometimes sacrifice, a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate creatures through hemocraft magic. You gain one blood curse of your choice, detailed in the &ldquo;<a title=\"Blood Curses\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/blood-hunter#BloodCurses-1611383\">Blood Curses</a>&rdquo; section at the end of the class description. You learn one additional blood curse of your choice, and you can choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse, at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>\r\n<p>When you use your Blood Maledict, you choose which curse to invoke. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by losing a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse’s description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are immune to blood curses, unless you have amplified the curse.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Blood Maledict feature twice, at 13th level you can use it three times between rests, and at 17th level, you can use it four times between rests. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Crimson Rite</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you learn to invoke a rite of hemocraft within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose one rite from the Primal Rites list below to learn.</p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can activate a crimson rite on a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite of your choice that lasts until you finish a short or long rest, or if you aren’t holding the weapon at the end of your turn. When you activate a rite, you lose a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table.</p>\r\n<p>For the duration, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen rite’s type. This damage is magical, and increases as you gain levels as a blood hunter, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. A weapon can only hold a single active rite at a time.</p>\r\n<p>You learn an additional Primal Rite at 7th level, and access to an Esoteric Rite at 14th level.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"PrimalRites\">Primal Rites</h4>\r\n<p>Choose from the following:</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Flame.</strong></em> Your rite damage is fire damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Frozen.</strong></em> Your rite damage is cold damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Storm.</strong></em> Your rite damage is lightning damage.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"EsotericRites\">Esoteric Rites</h4>\r\n<p>Choose from the following:</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Dead.</strong></em> Your rite damage is necrotic damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Oracle.</strong></em> Your rite damage is psychic damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Roar.</strong></em> Your rite damage is thunder damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Hunter Order</b></p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you commit to an order of blood hunter martial focus. Choose Order of the Ghostslayer, Order of the Profane Soul, Order of the Mutant, or Order of the Lycan, all detailed at the end of the class description. The order you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Brand of Castigation</b></p>\n<p>At 6th level, whenever you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite feature, you can choose to sear an arcane brand of hemocraft magic into it (requires no action). You always know the direction to the branded creature, and each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the creature takes psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 damage).</p>\r\n<p>Your brand lasts until you dismiss it, or you apply a brand to another creature. Your brand counts as a spell for the purposes of dispel magic, and the spell level is equal to half of your blood hunter level (maximum of 9th level spell).</p>\r\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Grim Psychometry</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 9th level, you have a supernatural talent for discerning the history surrounding mysterious objects or places touched by evil. When making an Intelligence (History) check to recall information about a darker past surrounding an object you are touching, or a location you are present in, you have advantage on the roll. The information gleaned often leans towards the more sinister influences of the past, and sometimes conveys&nbsp;visions of things previously unknown to the character on higher rolls.</p>\n\n<p><b>Dark Augmentation</b></p>\n<p>Upon reaching 10th level, arcane blood magic suffuses your body, permanently reinforcing your resilience. Your speed increases by 5 feet, and whenever you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\n\n<p><b>Brand of Tethering</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 13th level, the psychic damage from your Brand of Castigation increases to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2 damage).</p>\r\n<p>In addition, a branded creature can’t take the Dash action, and if a creature branded by you attempts to teleport or leave their current plane via ability, spell, or portal, they take 4d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the teleport or plane shift fails.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hardened Soul</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sanguine Mastery</b></p>\n<p>Upon becoming 20th level, you hone your control over blood magic, mitigating your sacrifice and empowering your capability. Once per turn, whenever a blood hunter feature requires you to roll a hemocraft die, you can choose to reroll the die and choose which result to use.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon attack empowered by your Crimson Rite, you regain one expended use of your Blood Maledict feature.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Curses</b></p>\n<p>The blood curses are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheAnxious\">Blood Curse of the Anxious</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you magnify the adrenaline in the body of a creature within 30 feet of you, making them susceptible to forceful influence. Until the end of your next turn, all creatures have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks directed at the target creature.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Amplify.</strong></em> The next Wisdom saving throw the target makes before this curse ends has disadvantage. Once you’ve amplified this blood curse, you must finish a long rest before you can amplify it again.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofBinding\">Blood Curse of Binding</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can attempt to bind a creature you can see within 30 feet of you that is no more than one size larger than you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have their speed be reduced to 0 and they can’t use reactions until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> This curse lasts for 1 minute and can affect a creature regardless of their size. At the end of each of its turns, the cursed creature can make another Strength saving throw. On a success, this curse ends.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofBloatedAgony\">Blood Curse of Bloated Agony</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you curse a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you to painfully swell until the end of your next turn. For the duration of this curse, the creature has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks, and suffers 1d8 necrotic damage if it makes more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> This curse lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the cursed creature can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, this curse ends.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofCorrosion\">Blood Curse of Corrosion</h5>\r\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 15th level, Order of the Mutant</em></p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, a creature within 30 feet of you becomes poisoned. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the curse ends.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The cursed creature suffers 4d6 necrotic damage, and suffers this damage again every time it fails its Constitution saving throw to end this curse at the end of its turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheExorcist\">Blood Curse of the Exorcist</h5>\r\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 15th level, Order of the Ghostslayer</em></p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you that is charmed, frightened, or possessed. The target creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The creature that charmed, frightened, or possessed the target of your curse suffers 3d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofExposure\">Blood Curse of Exposure</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet is hit by an attack or spell, you can use your reaction to temporarily weaken their resilience against it. Until the end of the turn, the target loses resistance to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Amplify.</strong></em> The target instead loses invulnerability to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell, having resistance to them until the end of the turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheEyeless\">Blood Curse of the Eyeless</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll one hemocraft die and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s attack roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature’s roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll succeeds. The creature is immune if it is immune to blindness.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> You apply this curse to all of the creature’s attack rolls until the end of the turn. You roll a new hemocraft die for each affected attack.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheFallenPuppet\">Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you drops to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to give that creature a final act of aggression. That creature immediately makes a single weapon attack against a target of your choice within its attack range.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> You can first move the cursed creature up to half their speed, and you grant a bonus to the cursed creature’s attack roll equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheHowl\">Blood Curse of the Howl</h5>\r\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 18th level, Order of the Lycan</em></p>\r\n<p>As an action, you unleash a blood-curdling howl. Each creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. If they fail their saving throw by 5 or more, they are stunned while frightened in this way. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this blood curse for the next 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the howl.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Amplify.</strong></em> The range of this curse increases to 60 feet.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheMarked\">Blood Curse of the Marked</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can mark a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. Until the end of your turn, whenever you deal rite damage to the target, you roll an additional hemocraft die of rite damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn has advantage.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheMuddledMind\">Blood Curse of the Muddled Mind</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you curse a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you that is concentrating on a spell. That creature has disadvantage on the next Constitution saving throw it must make to maintain concentration before the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The cursed creature has disadvantage on all Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration of spells until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheSouleater\">Blood Curse of the Souleater</h5>\r\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 18th level, Order of the Profane Soul</em></p>\r\n<p>When a creature that isn’t a construct or undead is reduced to 0 hit points within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to usher their soul to your patron in exchange for power. Until the end of your next turn, your weapon attacks have advantage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Amplify.</strong></em> In addition, you regain an expended warlock spell slot.

Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blessed Healer</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.JvD1bRSyvFpkyCQR]{Blessed Healer}</p>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Strike</b></p>\n<p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Supreme Healing</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.6xHH8l05b1GEQpjr]{Supreme Healing}</p>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Cleric)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=2&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the cleric spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Domain</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for details on all the domains.Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Domain Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each domain has a list of spells &mdash; its domain spells &mdash; that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Destroy Undead</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Destroy Undead Table</h4>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">Cleric Level</p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Destroys Undead of CR ...</p>\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">5th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1/2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">8th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">11th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">14th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">3 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">17th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">4 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Intervention</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action.

You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">hallow</span> spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>\n\n<p><b>Lay on Hands</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level &times; 5.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.

To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Smite</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Health</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sacred Oath</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Oath Spells</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Protection</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Courage</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Improved Divine Smite</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cleansing Touch</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once).

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> using either slot.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n\n<p><b>Ranger Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: the Hunter that is detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Primeval Awareness</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Land’s Stride</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">entangle</span> spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Vanish</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Senses</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Foe Slayer</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>Light armor, medium armor, shields<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Simple weapons, martial weapons<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Strength, Dexterity<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d10 per ranger level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>10 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per ranger level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 89","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["ath","ins","inv","nat","prc","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"half"},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":5,"data":{"id":5,"name":"Ranger","description":"<p>A warrior who combats threats on the edges of civilization</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d10<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong>&nbsp;Dexterity &amp; Wisdom<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Strength &amp;&nbsp;Dexterity</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) scale mail or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) leather armor</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) two shortswords or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) two simple melee weapons</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/366/636272702825813090.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/367/636272702826438096.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/7/636336417569697438.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/ranger","spellCastingAbilityId":5,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":89,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":10,"classFeatures":[{"id":294,"name":"Favored Enemy","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead.

Arcane Archers are some of the most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.</p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Archer Lore</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.3iPzciVdBxgOGSUF]{Arcane Archer Lore}</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature &mdash; typical for practitioners of this elven martial tradition. You choose to gain proficiency in either the&nbsp;Arcana or the Nature&nbsp;skill, and you choose to learn either the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\"><em>prestidigitation</em></span> or the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\"><em>druidcraft</em></span>&nbsp;cantrip.</p>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Shot</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.SU3KiTm3Fcn1yfjw]{Arcane Shot}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see &ldquo;Arcane Shot Options&rdquo; below).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once per turn when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack&nbsp;action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits a creature, unless the option doesn’t involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

Whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a shortbow or longbow, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.</p>\n\n<p><b>Curving Shot</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.m3GZh4fr3mJFlPMc]{Curving Shot}</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant arrow toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with a magic arrow and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ever-Ready Shot</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.KSQ2q2aZIhwxoPkO]{Ever-Ready Shot}</p>\n<p>Starting at 15th level, your magical archery is available whenever battle starts.

On your turn, you can take one additional action.</p>\r\n<p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

A Samurai’s resolve is nearly unbreakable, and the enemies in a Samurai’s path have two choices: yield or die fighting.</p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Bonus Proficiency</b></p>\n<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: History,&nbsp;Insight,&nbsp;Performance, or&nbsp;Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Spirit</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.CoghI97OvK9wjGM0]{Fighting Spirit}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, your intensity in battle can shield you and help you strike true. As a bonus action on your turn, you can give yourself advantage on weapon attack rolls until the end of the current turn. When you do so, you also gain 5 temporary hit points. The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 10 at 10th level and 15 at 15th level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature three times, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Elegant Courtier</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.kGBf2ddVg3zwiOzI]{Elegant Courtier}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 7th level, your discipline and attention to detail allow you to excel in social situations. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your self-control also causes you to gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).</p>\n\n<p><b>Tireless Spirit</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.EDCnZH5Cb43oehpS]{Tireless Spirit}</p>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Fighting Spirit remaining, you regain one use.</p>\n\n<p><b>Rapid Strike</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.RpY2pPV4a8pIUFBC]{Rapid Strike}</p>\n<p>Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you take the Attack&nbsp;action on your turn and have advantage on an attack roll against one of the targets, you can forgo the advantage for that roll to make an additional weapon attack against that target, as part of the same action. You can do so no more than once per turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Strength before Death</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.KMBQ7S9LEIn5DDXo]{Strength before Death}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points and doesn’t kill you outright, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall&nbsp;unconscious&nbsp;if you still have 0 hit points.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body _idGenParaOverride-1\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Second Wind</b></p>\n<p>You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Action Surge</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.</p>\r\n<p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Martial Archetype</b></p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques.

It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any <span class=\"No-Break\">circumstance.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.</p>\n\n<p><b>War Priest</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.qskJ22M8DbZxC9fl]{War Priest}</p>\n<p>From 1st level, your god delivers bolts of inspiration to you while you are engaged in battle. When you use the Attack action, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity: Guided Strike</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.sXOmIISz7vI5Fi2t]{Channel Divinity: Guided Strike}</p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity: War God’s Blessing</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.cCUC7xKN59aB67s6]{Channel Divinity: War God’s Blessing}</p>\n<p>At 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant that creature a +10 bonus to the roll, using your Channel Divinity. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Strike</b></p>\n<p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Avatar of Battle</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.zQWIpFMXY0nHDXl1]{Avatar of Battle}</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Cleric)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=2&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the cleric spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Domain</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for details on all the domains.Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Domain Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each domain has a list of spells &mdash; its domain spells &mdash; that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Destroy Undead</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Destroy Undead Table</h4>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">Cleric Level</p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Destroys Undead of CR ...</p>\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">5th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1/2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">8th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">11th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">14th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">3 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">17th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">4 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Intervention</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor:</span></strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons:</span></strong> Simple weapons<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Wisdom, Charisma<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills:</span></strong> Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d8 per cleric level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per cleric level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["his","ins","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"full"},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":2,"data":{"id":2,"name":"Cleric","description":"<p>A priestly champion who wields divine magic in service of a higher power</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Wisdom<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Wisdom &amp; Charisma</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a mace or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a warhammer (if proficient)</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) scale mail, (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) leather armor, or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">c</span>) chain mail (if proficient)</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a priest’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A shield and a holy symbol</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/370/636272706154751958.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/371/636272706155064423.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/2/636336417054144618.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/cleric","spellCastingAbilityId":5,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":8,"classFeatures":[{"id":108,"name":"Spellcasting","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.

You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spell Slots</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher.

Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class.

If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bard College</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore detailed at the end of the class description or another from the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Player's Handbook</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or other sources.

In addition, the first creature you hit during the first round of a combat becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls against that target have advantage until the start of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sudden Strike</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.FUwpL7ILfwXyMfCK]{Sudden Strike}</p>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, you can strike with deadly speed. If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as a bonus action.

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sneak Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>\n\n<p><b>Thieves’ Cant</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cunning Action</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or&nbsp;Hide action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Roguish Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Uncanny Dodge</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">ice storm</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reliable Talent</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blindsense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slippery Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n\n<p><b>Elusive</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stroke of Luck</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor</span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">:</span></strong> Light armor<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons:</span></strong> Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>Thieves’ tools<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Dexterity, Intelligence<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice:</span></strong> 1d8 per rogue level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 94","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","prc","prf","per"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":""},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":12,"data":{"id":12,"name":"Rogue","description":"<p>A scoundrel who uses stealth and trickery to overcome obstacles and enemies</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Dexterity<br /><strong>Saves:</strong>&nbsp;Dexterity &amp; Intelligence</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a rapier or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a burglar’s pack, (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">c</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/383/636272820318807897.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/384/636272820319276620.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/8/636336417681318097.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/rogue","spellCastingAbilityId":null,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":94,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":8,"classFeatures":[{"id":313,"name":"Ability Score Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spell Slots</span></h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">charm person</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">charm person</span> using either slot.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</span></h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard spell list.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spellcasting Ability</span></h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p

The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell’s effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it doesn’t need to be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your spell slots. The creature can’t cast that spell until the 8 hours have passed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Expertise</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sneak Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>\n\n<p><b>Thieves’ Cant</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cunning Action</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or&nbsp;Hide action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Roguish Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Uncanny Dodge</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">ice storm</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reliable Talent</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blindsense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slippery Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n\n<p><b>Elusive</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stroke of Luck</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor</span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">:</span></strong> Light armor<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons:</span></strong> Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>Thieves’ tools<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Dexterity, Intelligence<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice:</span></strong> 1d8 per rogue level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 94","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","prc","prf","per"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"third"},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":12,"data":{"id":12,"name":"Rogue","description":"<p>A scoundrel who uses stealth and trickery to overcome obstacles and enemies</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Dexterity<br /><strong>Saves:</strong>&nbsp;Dexterity &amp; Intelligence</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a rapier or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a burglar’s pack, (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">c</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/383/636272820318807897.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/384/636272820319276620.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/8/636336417681318097.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/rogue","spellCastingAbilityId":null,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":94,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":8,"classFeatures":[{"id":313,"name":"Ability Score Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice.

As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Turn the Faithless. </span></strong>You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Warding</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.1BRnvzzSL9HH32OO]{Aura of Warding}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Undying Sentinel</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.UNMICTYNh5PI6Yvd]{Undying Sentinel}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead.

To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.

Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Oath Spells</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity</h4>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Protection</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1).

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as on Intelligence ability checks to recall information about them.</p>\r\n<p>The Hunter’s Bane also empowers your body to control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your abilities. Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hemocraft save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Maledict</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.J5mZhEFMUvGl0tHF]{Blood Maledict}</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel, and sometimes sacrifice, a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate creatures through hemocraft magic. You gain one blood curse of your choice, detailed in the &ldquo;<a title=\"Blood Curses\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/blood-hunter#BloodCurses-1611383\">Blood Curses</a>&rdquo; section at the end of the class description. You learn one additional blood curse of your choice, and you can choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse, at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>\r\n<p>When you use your Blood Maledict, you choose which curse to invoke. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by losing a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse’s description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are immune to blood curses, unless you have amplified the curse.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Blood Maledict feature twice, at 13th level you can use it three times between rests, and at 17th level, you can use it four times between rests. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Crimson Rite</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.K7XYAkjcy1KODvRc]{Crimson Rite}</p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you learn to invoke a rite of hemocraft within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose one rite from the Primal Rites list below to learn.</p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can activate a crimson rite on a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite of your choice that lasts until you finish a short or long rest, or if you aren’t holding the weapon at the end of your turn. When you activate a rite, you lose a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table.</p>\r\n<p>For the duration, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen rite’s type. This damage is magical, and increases as you gain levels as a blood hunter, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. A weapon can only hold a single active rite at a time.</p>\r\n<p>You learn an additional Primal Rite at 7th level, and access to an Esoteric Rite at 14th level.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"PrimalRites\">Primal Rites</h4>\r\n<p>Choose from the following:</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Flame.</strong></em> Your rite damage is fire damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Frozen.</strong></em> Your rite damage is cold damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Storm.</strong></em> Your rite damage is lightning damage.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"EsotericRites\">Esoteric Rites</h4>\r\n<p>Choose from the following:</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Dead.</strong></em> Your rite damage is necrotic damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Oracle.</strong></em> Your rite damage is psychic damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Roar.</strong></em> Your rite damage is thunder damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Hunter Order</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.9BasCwMsjYq42gTQ]{Blood Hunter Order}</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you commit to an order of blood hunter martial focus. Choose Order of the Ghostslayer, Order of the Profane Soul, Order of the Mutant, or Order of the Lycan, all detailed at the end of the class description. The order you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Brand of Castigation</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.86X2rgF7gODp5kUe]{Brand of Castigation}</p>\n<p>At 6th level, whenever you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite feature, you can choose to sear an arcane brand of hemocraft magic into it (requires no action). You always know the direction to the branded creature, and each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the creature takes psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 damage).</p>\r\n<p>Your brand lasts until you dismiss it, or you apply a brand to another creature. Your brand counts as a spell for the purposes of dispel magic, and the spell level is equal to half of your blood hunter level (maximum of 9th level spell).</p>\r\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Grim Psychometry</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.JzkdYaZWHdWo7K37]{Grim Psychometry}</p>\n<p>When you reach 9th level, you have a supernatural talent for discerning the history surrounding mysterious objects or places touched by evil. When making an Intelligence (History) check to recall information about a darker past surrounding an object you are touching, or a location you are present in, you have advantage on the roll. The information gleaned often leans towards the more sinister influences of the past, and sometimes conveys&nbsp;visions of things previously unknown to the character on higher rolls.</p>\n\n<p><b>Dark Augmentation</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.YYaTg3hsZSS2iKyg]{Dark Augmentation}</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 10th level, arcane blood magic suffuses your body, permanently reinforcing your resilience. Your speed increases by 5 feet, and whenever you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\n\n<p><b>Brand of Tethering</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.DLHAwix7ifQqCzJP]{Brand of Tethering}</p>\n<p>Starting at 13th level, the psychic damage from your Brand of Castigation increases to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2 damage).</p>\r\n<p>In addition, a branded creature can’t take the Dash action, and if a creature branded by you attempts to teleport or leave their current plane via ability, spell, or portal, they take 4d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the teleport or plane shift fails.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hardened Soul</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.L7Ujbx9KasvIk6g6]{Hardened Soul}</p>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sanguine Mastery</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.Lvgc1z6OdSrvR8Ea]{Sanguine Mastery}</p>\n<p>Upon becoming 20th level, you hone your control over blood magic, mitigating your sacrifice and empowering your capability. Once per turn, whenever a blood hunter feature requires you to roll a hemocraft die, you can choose to reroll the die and choose which result to use.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon attack empowered by your Crimson Rite, you regain one expended use of your Blood Maledict feature.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Curses</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.hk31adOHCDBzRmd0]{Blood Curses}</p>\n<p>The blood curses are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheAnxious\">Blood Curse of the Anxious</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you magnify the adrenaline in the body of a creature within 30 feet of you, making them susceptible to forceful influence. Until the end of your next turn, all creatures have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks directed at the target creature.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Amplify.</strong></em> The next Wisdom saving throw the target makes before this curse ends has disadvantage. Once you’ve amplified this blood curse, you must finish a long rest before you can amplify it again.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofBinding\">Blood Curse of Binding</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can attempt to bind a creature you can see within 30 feet of you that is no more than one size larger than you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have their speed be reduced to 0 and they can’t use reactions until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> This curse lasts for 1 minute and can affect a creature regardless of their size. At the end of each of its turns, the cursed creature can make another Strength saving throw. On a success, this curse ends.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofBloatedAgony\">Blood Curse of Bloated Agony</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you curse a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you to painfully swell until the end of your next turn. For the duration of this curse, the creature has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks, and suffers 1d8 necrotic damage if it makes more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> This curse lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the cursed creature can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, this curse ends.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofCorrosion\">Blood Curse of Corrosion</h5>\r\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 15th level, Order of the Mutant</em></p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, a creature within 30 feet of you becomes poisoned. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw.

Until the end of the turn, the target loses resistance to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Amplify.</strong></em> The target instead loses invulnerability to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell, having resistance to them until the end of the turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheEyeless\">Blood Curse of the Eyeless</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll one hemocraft die and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s attack roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature’s roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll succeeds. The creature is immune if it is immune to blindness.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> You apply this curse to all of the creature’s attack rolls until the end of the turn. You roll a new hemocraft die for each affected attack.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheFallenPuppet\">Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you drops to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to give that creature a final act of aggression. That creature immediately makes a single weapon attack against a target of your choice within its attack range.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> You can first move the cursed creature up to half their speed, and you grant a bonus to the cursed creature’s attack roll equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheHowl\">Blood Curse of the Howl</h5>\r\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 18th level, Order of the Lycan</em></p>\r\n<p>As an action, you unleash a blood-curdling howl. Each creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. If they fail their saving throw by 5 or more, they are stunned while frightened in this way. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this blood curse for the next 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the howl.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Amplify.</strong></em> The range of this curse increases to 60 feet.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheMarked\">Blood Curse of the Marked</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can mark a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you.

nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Nature’s Ward</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Nature’s Sanctuary</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druidic</b></p>\n<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Druid)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=3&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the druid&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druid Circle</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p>\n\n<p><b>Beast Spells</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape.

To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.JokpOnFCgiMYD9G2]{Wild Shape}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.Akr7Ogpr5RL99fuF]{Wild Shape Improvement}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druid Circle</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.pybySqkggCWpX9E4]{Druid Circle}</p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>","requiredLevel":2,"displayOrder":5},{"id":168,"name":"Wild Shape Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed.

The druids’ guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with dreamy wonder.

The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.DS79biRTEHJbbw8t]{Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, home can be wherever you are. During a short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gloaming Court to help guard your respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn’t visible outside it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hidden Paths</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.PHzzmsrbUfTAN6Lf]{Hidden Paths}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you can use the hidden, magical pathways that some fey use to traverse space in the blink of an eye. As a bonus action on your turn, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, you can use your action to teleport one willing creature you touch up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Walker in Dreams</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.DrW28tTaLQw7dOuk]{Walker in Dreams}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 14th level, the magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or&nbsp;requiring&nbsp;material components: <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\"><em>dream</em></span>&nbsp;(with you as the messenger),&nbsp;<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\"><em>scrying</em>&nbsp;</span>, or&nbsp;<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\"><em>teleportation circle</em></span>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">This use of&nbsp;<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\"><em>teleportation circle</em>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you haven’t taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn’t wasted.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druidic</b></p>\n<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druid Circle</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p>\n\n<p><b>Beast Spells</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape.

To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature.

Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally cou<span class=\"No-Break\">ldn’t employ.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Fast Hands</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.P18ZFu6x27zNE29f]{Fast Hands}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Second-Story Work</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.6sGXxBHZgp6c4sCx]{Second-Story Work}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Supreme Sneak</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.xhdG5L6kNzflwhCl]{Supreme Sneak}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Use Magic Device</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.cYplkQhqepUL9YWh]{Use Magic Device}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.</p>\n\n<p><b>Thief’s Reflexes</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.L6WZcFq4Iqtwxdxk]{Thief’s Reflexes}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Expertise</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sneak Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>\n\n<p><b>Thieves’ Cant</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cunning Action</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or&nbsp;Hide action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Roguish Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Uncanny Dodge</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">ice storm</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reliable Talent</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blindsense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slippery Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n\n<p><b>Elusive</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stroke of Luck</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor</span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">:</span></strong> Light armor<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons:</span></strong> Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>Thieves’ tools<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Dexterity, Intelligence<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice:</span></strong> 1d8 per rogue level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 94","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","prc","prf","per"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":""},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":12,"data":{"id":12,"name":"Rogue","description":"<p>A scoundrel who uses stealth and trickery to overcome obstacles and enemies</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Dexterity<br /><strong>Saves:</strong>&nbsp;Dexterity &amp; Intelligence</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a rapier or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a burglar’s pack, (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">c</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/383/636272820318807897.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/384/636272820319276620.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/8/636336417681318097.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/rogue","spellCastingAbilityId":null,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":94,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":8,"classFeatures":[{"id":313,"name":"Ability Score Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

They’re patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators.

This blessing lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.yhjj8quD66vVQzIf]{Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity}</p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate of yourself.</p>\r\n<p>As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.</p>\r\n<p>For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion’s space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.O4i03bLUJXFLPH9T]{Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows}</p>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to vanish.</p>\r\n<p>As an action, you become invisible until the end of your next turn. You become visible if you attack or cast a spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Strike</b></p>\n<p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with poison &mdash; a gift from your deity. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 poison damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Improved Duplicity</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.KmXV3U8PyTY2dA35]{Improved Duplicity}</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can create up to four duplicates of yourself, instead of one, when you use Invoke Duplicity. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any number of them up to 30 feet, to a maximum range of 120 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Cleric)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=2&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the cleric spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Domain</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for details on all the domains.Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Domain Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each domain has a list of spells &mdash; its domain spells &mdash; that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Destroy Undead</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Destroy Undead Table</h4>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">Cleric Level</p>\r\n</th>\r\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Destroys Undead of CR ...</p>\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">5th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1/2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">8th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">1 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">11th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">2 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">14th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">3 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">17th</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\r\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">4 or lower</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Intervention</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor:</span></strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons:</span></strong> Simple weapons<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Wisdom, Charisma<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills:</span></strong> Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d8 per cleric level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per cleric level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["his","ins","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"full"},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":2,"data":{"id":2,"name":"Cleric","description":"<p>A priestly champion who wields divine magic in service of a higher power</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Wisdom<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Wisdom &amp; Charisma</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a mace or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a warhammer (if proficient)</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) scale mail, (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) leather armor, or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">c</span>) chain mail (if proficient)</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a priest’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A shield and a holy symbol</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/370/636272706154751958.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/371/636272706155064423.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/2/636336417054144618.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/cleric","spellCastingAbilityId":5,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":8,"classFeatures":[{"id":108,"name":"Spellcasting","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.

Once this feature turns a failure into a success, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Breath of the Dragon</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.H1pSC0VM5hlbWCFx]{Breath of the Dragon}</p>\n<p><em>3rd-level Way of the Ascendant Dragon feature</em></p>\r\n<p>You can channel your ki into destructive waves of energy like the dragons you emulate. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with an exhalation of draconic energy in either a 20-foot cone or a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice). Choose a&nbsp;damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ki save DC, taking damage of the chosen type equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.</p>\r\n<p>At 11th level, the damage of your breath increases to three rolls of your Martial Arts die.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses available, you can spend 1 ki point to use this feature again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wings Unfurled</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.5lwtK2nUDaPfmV8M]{Wings Unfurled}</p>\n<p><em>6th-level Way of the Ascendant Dragon feature</em></p>\r\n<p>When you use your Step of the Wind, you can unfurl spectral draconic wings from your back that vanish at the end of your turn. While the wings exist, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses available, you can spend 1 additional ki point when you activate Step of the Wind to use this feature again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aspect of the Wyrm</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.creZCmZqcJXNE57A]{Aspect of the Wyrm}</p>\n<p><em>11th-level Way of the Ascendant Dragon feature</em></p>\r\n<p>The power of your draconic ki now radiates from you, protecting your allies from harm and punishing any who raise arms against them. As a bonus action, you can create an aura of draconic power that radiates 30 feet from you for 1 minute. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage, and for the duration, you gain the following effects:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You and your allies within your aura gain resistance to the chosen damage type.</li>\r\n<li>Waves of destructive energy flow out from you and your allies when any of you are attacked. When you or one of your allies in the aura is hit by an attack made by another creature within the aura, the target that was hit can use their reaction to deal an amount of damage of the chosen type equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die to the attacker.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once you use this bonus action, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 4 ki points to use it again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ascendant Aspect</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.3pCWNMXIKsh7ObvF]{Ascendant Aspect}</p>\n<p><em>17th-level Way of the Ascendant Dragon feature</em></p>\r\n<p>Your draconic ki reaches its peak. You gain the following benefits:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You gain blindsight out to 30 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if you’re blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</li>\r\n<li>When you damage a creature with your Breath of the Dragon, the energy clings to the target. At the start of each of the creature’s turns, it takes damage of the type your breath dealt equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die. At the end of its turn, the creature can repeat the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>\r\n<li>When you activate your Aspect of the Wyrm, draconic fury explodes from you. Choose any number of creatures you can see within your aura. Those creatures each take 4d10 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice).</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Martial Arts</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the <a title=\"Weapons\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Weapons\">Weapons</a> section.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong>, <strong>Patient Defense</strong>, and <strong>Step of the Wind</strong>. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Ki save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Flurry of Blows</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Patient Defense</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Step of the Wind</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Monastic Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Deflect Missiles</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slow Fall</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stunning Strike</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki-Empowered Strikes</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">fireball</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stillness of Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Purity of Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.</p>\n\n<p><b>Diamond Soul</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.</p>\n\n<p><b>Empty Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">astral projection</span> spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Perfect Self</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during your move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Simple weapons, shortswords<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>Choose one type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Strength, Dexterity<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills:</span></strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice:</span></strong> 1d8 per monk level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 76","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ath","his","ins","rel","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":""},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":11,"data":{"id":11,"name":"Monk","description":"<p>A master of martial arts, harnessing the power of the body in pursuit of physical and spiritual perfection</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Dexterity &amp; Wisdom<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Strength &amp; Dexterity</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortsword or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted ParaOverride-7\">10 darts</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/488/636274646181088338.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/489/636274646181411106.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/5/636336417372349522.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/monk","spellCastingAbilityId":null,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":76,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":8,"classFeatures":[{"id":226,"name":"Unarmored Defense","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3},{"id":227,"name":"Martial Arts","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon.

Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter’s reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in<span class=\"No-Break\"> a spellbook.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #704cd9;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Wizard Spells\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-verbal=&amp;filter-somatic=&amp;filter-material=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-sub-class=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Cantrips</span></h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spell Slots</span></h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">shield</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">shield</span> using either slot.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</span></h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\"><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spellcasting Ability</span></h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p

You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.</p>\n\n<p><b>War Magic</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.KyJD6t5cXzKLgioj]{War Magic}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Eldritch Strike</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.mEbC9o6nGCJXPEhl]{Eldritch Strike}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature’s resistance to your spells.

To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on rea<span class=\"No-Break\">lity’s forge.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and de<span class=\"No-Break\">stroy worlds.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Transmutation Savant</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.H9vwP91xRH2zJry5]{Transmutation Savant}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>\n\n<p><b>Minor Alchemy</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.jNyXTU2tDUSkox0T]{Minor Alchemy}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.</p>\n\n<p><b>Transmuter’s Stone</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.rvVhpqCGhOA6mdUY]{Transmuter’s Stone}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter’s stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature’s possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Proficiency in Constitution saving throws</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you create a new transmuter’s stone, the previous one ceases to function.</p>\n\n<p><b>Shapechanger</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.DwSwDmiDMKJ7NEzp]{Shapechanger}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 10th level, you add the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">polymorph</span> spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">polymorph</span> without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">polymorph</span> in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.</p>\n\n<p><b>Master Transmuter</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.SnsQIQferR16OZOw]{Master Transmuter}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter’s stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter’s stone is destroyed and can’t be remade until you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Major Transformation. </span></strong>You can transmute one nonmagical object&mdash;no larger than a 5-foot cube&mdash;into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Panacea. </span></strong>You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter’s stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Restore Life. </span></strong>You cast the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">raise dead</span> spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter’s stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Restore Youth.</span></strong> You touch the transmuter’s stone to a willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Recovery</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation&nbsp;is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spell Mastery</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>\n\n<p><b>Signature Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells.

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3},{"id":411,"name":"Arcane Recovery","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druid Circle</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly.

To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

You can speak, read, and write Primordial. Knowing this language allows you to understand and be understood by those who speak its dialects: Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tempestuous Magic</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.bsiCAyvQbSgJelc0]{Tempestuous Magic}</p>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause whirling gusts of elemental air to briefly surround you, immediately before or after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows you to fly up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>\n\n<p><b>Heart of the Storm</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.vRacYWB75JIJrTWk]{Heart of the Storm}</p>\n<p>At 6th level, you gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals lightning or thunder damage, stormy magic erupts from you. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to take lightning or thunder damage (choose each time this ability activates) equal to half your sorcerer level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Storm Guide</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.zvufRGPKLrSXStE7]{Storm Guide}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to subtly control the weather around you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If it is raining, you can use an action to cause the rain to stop falling in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you. You can end this effect as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If it is windy, you can use a bonus action each round to choose the direction that the wind blows in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on you. The wind blows in that direction until the end of your next turn. This feature doesn’t alter the speed of the wind.</p>\n\n<p><b>Storm’s Fury</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.8XmPphPLX04qJhFS]{Storm’s Fury}</p>\n<p>Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal lightning damage to the attacker. The damage equals your sorcerer level. The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet away from you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wind Soul</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.KbUzB4pVwDlgAqNX]{Wind Soul}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you gain immunity to lightning and thunder damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You also gain a magical flying speed of 60 feet. As an action, you can reduce your flying speed to 30 feet for 1 hour and choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. The chosen creatures gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet for 1 hour. Once you reduce your flying speed in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spell Slots</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">burning hands</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">burning hands</span> using either slot.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sorcerous Origin</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Font of Magic</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Sorcery Points</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Flexible Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Creating Spell Slots.</span></strong> You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level.

As a bonus action, you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. The first time each turn that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It ends early if you designate a different creature.</p>\n\n<p><b>Supernatural Defense</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.j93SvkGxV2lFI9QT]{Supernatural Defense}</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you gain extra resilience against your prey’s assaults on your mind and body. Whenever the target of your Slayer’s Prey forces you to make a saving throw and whenever you make an ability check to escape that target’s grapple, add 1d6 to your roll.</p>\n\n<p><b>Magic-User’s Nemesis</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.eUmTaJZSiJr3tATZ]{Magic-User’s Nemesis}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 11th level, you gain the ability to thwart someone else’s magic. When you see a creature casting a spell or teleporting within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to try to magically foil it. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or its spell or teleport fails and is wasted.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slayer’s Counter</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.5ggViNrgjNH0hf9U]{Slayer’s Counter}</p>\n<p>At 15th level, you gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. If the target of your Slayer’s Prey forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against the quarry. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If your attack hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attack’s normal effects.</p>\n\n<p><b>Favored Enemy</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.</p>\n\n<p><b>Natural Explorer</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> using either slot.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n\n<p><b>Ranger Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: the Hunter that is detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Primeval Awareness</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Land’s Stride</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">entangle</span> spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Vanish</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Senses</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Foe Slayer</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies.

Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respec<span class=\"No-Break\">ted vocation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence mu<span class=\"No-Break\">st be closed.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Abjuration Savant</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.x15WHPGcMjn07xEl]{Abjuration Savant}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Ward</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.oCWRefkVcTiSThsn]{Arcane Ward}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has a hit point maximum equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">While the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you create the ward, you can’t create it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Projected Ward</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.Hxn7wVM4vABSy0qh]{Projected Ward}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Improved Abjuration</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.JlpMuqYfNJInod71]{Improved Abjuration}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 10th level, when you cast an abjuration spell that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell (as in <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">counterspell</span> and <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">dispel magic</span>), you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spell Resistance</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.99UfuV7D3ZhQ8XJI]{Spell Resistance}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage of spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Recovery</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation&nbsp;is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spell Mastery</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>\n\n<p><b>Signature Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor:</span></strong> None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Intelligence, Wisdom<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d6 per wizard level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>6 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels: </span></strong>1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 112","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"full"},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":8,"data":{"id":8,"name":"Wizard","description":"<p>A scholarly magic-user capable of manipulating the structures of reality</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d6<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong>&nbsp;Intelligence<br /><strong>Saves:</strong>&nbsp;Intelligence &amp; Wisdom</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a quarterstaff or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dagger</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a component pouch or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an arcane focus</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a scholar’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A spellbook</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/356/636272696880643718.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/357/636272696881281556.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/11/636336418370446635.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/wizard","spellCastingAbilityId":4,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":112,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":6,"classFeatures":[{"id":328,"name":"Ability Score Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3},{"id":411,"name":"Arcane Recovery","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces.

When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>\n\n<p><b>Lay on Hands</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level &times; 5.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.

The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.

The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.

You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don’t die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.</p>\n\n<p><b>Rage</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reckless Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Danger Sense</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Path</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Fast Movement</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Instinct</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Brutal Critical</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Relentless Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds.

If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Persistent Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Indomitable Might</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Champion</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds.

This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mantle of Majesty</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.CtovnU4OchPSfxXp]{Mantle of Majesty}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey magic that makes others want to serve you.

For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it can’t attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your spells on your next turn.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you assume this majestic presence, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music.

You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spell Slots</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class.

The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health o<span class=\"No-Break\">r well-being.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Frenzy</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.r25Y7TgXLafvWotW]{Frenzy}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mindless Rage</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.KQUbuunjB1qCLM6i]{Mindless Rage}</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while raging.

When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p><b>Retaliation</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.qkXqkDOJ60tiUqEs]{Retaliation}</p>\n<p>Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.</p>\n\n<p><b>Rage</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reckless Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Danger Sense</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Fast Movement</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Instinct</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Brutal Critical</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Relentless Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds.

If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Persistent Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Indomitable Might</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Champion</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds.

You rely on your sharp eye for detail, but also on your finely honed ability to read the words and deeds of other creatures to determine their true intent. You excel at defeating creatures that hide among and prey upon ordinary folk, and your mastery of lore and your keen deductions make you well equipped to expose and end hidden evils.</p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Ear for Deceit</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.pIdnXdJnRpDH74pv]{Ear for Deceit}</p>\n<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you develop a talent for picking out lies. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine whether a creature is lying, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Eye for Detail</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.KGEGGOJSPrt8J42G]{Eye for Detail}</p>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a hidden creature or object or to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to uncover or decipher clues.</p>\n\n<p><b>Insightful Fighting</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.ZtrbVEcyWZygNGlo]{Insightful Fighting}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 3rd level, you gain the ability to decipher an opponent’s tactics and develop a counter to them. As a bonus action, you can make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature you can see that isn’t incapacitated, contested by the target’s Charisma (Deception) check. If you succeed, you can use your Sneak Attack against that target even if you don’t have advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have disadvantage on it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you successfully use this feature against a different target.</p>\n\n<p><b>Steady Eye</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.ImPali10q2YxyYOV]{Steady Eye}</p>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unerring Eye</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.cFKiedCnjMYrExs2]{Unerring Eye}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 13th level, your senses are almost impossible to foil. As an action, you sense the presence of illusions, shapechangers not in their original form, and other magic designed to deceive the senses within 30 feet of you, provided you aren’t blinded&nbsp;or&nbsp;deafened. You sense that an effect is attempting to trick you, but you gain no insight into what is hidden or into its true nature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Eye for Weakness</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.Je0gwPyJF9iro3QN]{Eye for Weakness}</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you learn to exploit a creature’s weaknesses by carefully studying its tactics and movement. While your Insightful Fighting feature applies to a creature, your Sneak Attack damage against that creature increases by 3d6.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Expertise</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sneak Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>\n\n<p><b>Thieves’ Cant</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cunning Action</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or&nbsp;Hide action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Roguish Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Uncanny Dodge</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">ice storm</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reliable Talent</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blindsense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slippery Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n\n<p><b>Elusive</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stroke of Luck</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor</span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">:</span></strong> Light armor<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons:</span></strong> Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>Thieves’ tools<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Dexterity, Intelligence<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice:</span></strong> 1d8 per rogue level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 94","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","prc","prf","per"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":""},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":12,"data":{"id":12,"name":"Rogue","description":"<p>A scoundrel who uses stealth and trickery to overcome obstacles and enemies</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Dexterity<br /><strong>Saves:</strong>&nbsp;Dexterity &amp; Intelligence</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a rapier or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a burglar’s pack, (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">c</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/383/636272820318807897.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/384/636272820319276620.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/8/636336417681318097.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/rogue","spellCastingAbilityId":null,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":94,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":8,"classFeatures":[{"id":313,"name":"Ability Score Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real.

When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Illusory Reality</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.d1IpBMKCr5cVfKM5]{Illusory Reality}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The object can’t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Recovery</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation&nbsp;is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spell Mastery</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>\n\n<p><b>Signature Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot.

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3},{"id":411,"name":"Arcane Recovery","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook.

Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a Cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.</p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Bonus Proficiency</b></p>\n<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice:&nbsp;Animal Handling,&nbsp;History,&nbsp;Insight,&nbsp;Performance, or&nbsp;Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.</p>\n\n<p><b>Born to the Saddle</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.ULDzTVDqO2RLwHOy]{Born to the Saddle}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you’re not incapacitated.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unwavering Mark</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.0U3wyGqWGWRGyCRk]{Unwavering Mark}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated&nbsp;or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn’t target you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attack’s weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your fighter level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Warding Maneuver</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.QMPGVbFEWPsH2m8I]{Warding Maneuver}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you’re wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target’s AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack’s damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hold the Line</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.ivZdffFiVSjMKfib]{Hold the Line}</p>\n<p>At 10th level, you become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the target’s speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ferocious Charger</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.vJ1WT2dY0aKW1BmW]{Ferocious Charger}</p>\n<p>Starting at 15th level, you can run down your foes, whether you’re mounted or not. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.</p>\n\n<p><b>Vigilant Defender</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.i9RWWYbdWJ1NxAtX]{Vigilant Defender}</p>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, you respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature’s turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can’t use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Second Wind</b></p>\n<p>You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Action Surge</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.</p>\r\n<p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

As a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to magically summon a hound of ill omen to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the dire wolf statistics (see the&nbsp;<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">Monster Manual</span>&nbsp;or appendix C in the&nbsp;<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">Player’s Handbook</span>), with the following changes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain.

If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.</p>\n\n<p><b>Shadow Walk</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.jp8gvp13s8Y5pL5R]{Shadow Walk}</p>\n<p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another.

In this form, you have resistance to all damage except force and radiant damage, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You remain in this form for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you die, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">burning hands</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">burning hands</span> using either slot.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sorcerous Origin</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Font of Magic</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself.

The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\"><strong>Celestial Expanded Spells</strong></h5>\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Spell Level</th>\r\n<th>Spells</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1st</td>\r\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">cure wounds</span>,&nbsp;<span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">guiding bolt</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2nd</td>\r\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">flaming sphere</span>,&nbsp;<span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">lesser restoration</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>3rd</td>\r\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">daylight</span>,&nbsp;<span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">revivify</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>4th</td>\r\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">guardian of faith</span>,&nbsp;<span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">wall of fire</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>5th</td>\r\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">flame strike</span>,&nbsp;<span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">greater restoration</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\n\n<p><b>Bonus Cantrips</b></p>\n<p>At 1st level, you learn the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">light</span> and <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">sacred flame</span> cantrips. They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they don’t count against your number of cantrips known.</p>\n\n<p><b>Healing Light</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.82CPkTAScIpzZQIT]{Healing Light}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of hit points equal to&nbsp;the total.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a&nbsp;long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Radiant Soul</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.yfntFwdTWEnBNRox]{Radiant Soul}</p>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, your link to the Celestial allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell that deals radiant or fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one radiant or fire damage roll of that spell against one of its targets.</p>\n\n<p><b>Celestial Resilience</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.8OfDrZmH7khHENXH]{Celestial Resilience}</p>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, you gain temporary hit points whenever you finish a short or long rest. These temporary hit points equal your warlock level + your Charisma modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level + your Charisma&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Searing Vengeance</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.5UyLt6FzfPV34BVW]{Searing Vengeance}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, the radiant energy you channel allows you to resist death. When you have to make a death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant energy. You regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum, and then you stand up if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and it is blinded until the end of the current turn.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a&nbsp;long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Otherworldly Patron</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Fiend, which is detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Pact Magic</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.

You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spell Slots</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">witch bolt</span>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Eldritch Invocations</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>\n\n<p><b>Pact Boon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Metadata\">At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mystic Arcanum (6th level)</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Eldritch Master</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mystic Arcanum (7th level)</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 13th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 7th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level.

During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can’t make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Rakish Audacity</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.thetMllhWNQqbrrw]{Rakish Audacity}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, your confidence propels you into battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don’t need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Panache</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.xlM8nvofiOnZOIVq]{Panache}</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature’s Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can’t make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you succeed on the check and the creature isn’t hostile to you, it is charmed&nbsp;by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.</p>\n\n<p><b>Elegant Maneuver</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.CBmzW6TZ8dZPmZwM]{Elegant Maneuver}</p>\n<p>Starting at 13th level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Master Duelist</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.dECHQoINsnbCbfsJ]{Master Duelist}</p>\n<p>Beginning at 17th level, your mastery of the blade lets you turn failure into success in combat. If you miss with an attack roll, you can roll it again with advantage. Once you do so, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Expertise</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sneak Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>\n\n<p><b>Thieves’ Cant</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cunning Action</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or&nbsp;Hide action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Roguish Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Uncanny Dodge</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">ice storm</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reliable Talent</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blindsense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slippery Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n\n<p><b>Elusive</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stroke of Luck</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor</span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">:</span></strong> Light armor<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons:</span></strong> Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>Thieves’ tools<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Dexterity, Intelligence<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice:</span></strong> 1d8 per rogue level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 94","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","prc","prf","per"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":""},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":12,"data":{"id":12,"name":"Rogue","description":"<p>A scoundrel who uses stealth and trickery to overcome obstacles and enemies</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Dexterity<br /><strong>Saves:</strong>&nbsp;Dexterity &amp; Intelligence</p>","equipmentDescription":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a rapier or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a burglar’s pack, (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">c</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools</li>\r\n</ul>","parentClassId":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/383/636272820318807897.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6/384/636272820319276620.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/10/8/636336417681318097.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/characters/classes/rogue","spellCastingAbilityId":null,"sourceIds":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":94,"sourceType":1}],"hitDice":8,"classFeatures":[{"id":313,"name":"Ability Score Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s myst<span class=\"No-Break\">erious rites.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n\n<p><b>Bonus Cantrip</b></p>\n<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.</p>\n\n<p><b>Natural Recovery</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.ef54TMZ0CrSxGCcu]{Natural Recovery}</p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Land’s Stride</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Nature’s Ward</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.aDtERWfVlate56QG]{Nature’s Ward}</p>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Nature’s Sanctuary</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.8d1TSWZk4b8Qcdhe]{Nature’s Sanctuary}</p>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Circle Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land &mdash; arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark &mdash; and consult the associated list of spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Arctic</h5>\r\n<table

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Druid Circle</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p>\n\n<p><b>Beast Spells</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.</p>\n\n<p><b>Archdruid</b></p>\n<p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>","requiredLevel":2,"displayOrder":5},{"id":168,"name":"Wild Shape Improvement","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed.

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stormborn</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.CBXHCgvukpwyWEjF]{Stormborn}</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed whenever you are not underground or indoors.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"Spells Listing (Cleric)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=2&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the cleric spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Domain</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for details on all the domains.Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Domain Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each domain has a list of spells &mdash; its domain spells &mdash; that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.

You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

In addition, your blood curses can target any creature, whether it has blood or not.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ethereal Step</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.5NxSR88zUujGlcOQ]{Ethereal Step}</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 7th level, at the start of your turn, if you aren’t incapacitated, you can choose to magically step into the veil between the planes.</p>\r\n<p>You can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, as well as see and affect creatures and objects on the Ethereal Plane. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object. If you are inside an object when this feature ends, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you moved. This feature lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 round).</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature once. Beginning at 15th level, you can use your Ethereal Step feature twice between rests. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Brand of Sundering</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.7BEVF4MqW8rJzGYF]{Brand of Sundering}</p>\n<p>Beginning at 11th level, your Brand of Castigation now exposes a fragment of your foe’s essence, leaving them vulnerable to your Crimson Rite. Whenever you damage a branded creature with your Crimson Rite, your weapon deals one additional hemocraft die of rite damage. In addition, the branded creature can’t move through creatures or objects.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Curse of the Exorcist</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.ietVwWFi7RM6eNnh]{Blood Curse of the Exorcist}</p>\n<p>At 15th level, you’ve honed your hemocraft to tear wicked influence from your allies, punishing those who would infiltrate their body and mind. You gain the Blood Curse of the Exorcist for your Blood Maledict feature. This doesn’t count against your number of blood curses known.</p>\n\n<p><b>Rite Revival</b> @Compendium[world.ddb-za-warudo-class-features.7EAycAEYKoww91rh]{Rite Revival}</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 18th level, you learn to protect your fading life by absorbing your blood rite. When you are reduced to 0 hit points while you have an active Crimson Rite, but don’t die outright, the rite ends and you drop to 1 hit point instead. If you have rites active on multiple weapons, you choose which one ends.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong>&nbsp;1d10 per blood hunter&nbsp;level<br /><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong>&nbsp;10 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong>&nbsp;1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per blood hunter level after 1st</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong>Armor:</strong>&nbsp;Light armor, medium armor, shields<br /><strong>Weapons:</strong>&nbsp;Simple weapons, martial weapons<br /><strong>Tools:</strong>&nbsp;Alchemist’s supplies<br /><strong>Saving Throws:</strong>&nbsp;Dexterity, Intelligence<br /><strong>Skills:</strong>&nbsp;Choose three from Athletics, Acrobatics, Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Religion, and Survival</p>\n\n<p><b>Hunter's Bane</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, you have survived the Hunter’s Bane, a dangerous, long-guarded ritual that alters your life’s blood, forever binding you to the darkness and honing your senses against it. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as on Intelligence ability checks to recall information about them.</p>\r\n<p>The Hunter’s Bane also empowers your body to control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your abilities. Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hemocraft save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Maledict</b></p>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel, and sometimes sacrifice, a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate creatures through hemocraft magic. You gain one blood curse of your choice, detailed in the &ldquo;<a title=\"Blood Curses\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/blood-hunter#BloodCurses-1611383\">Blood Curses</a>&rdquo; section at the end of the class description. You learn one additional blood curse of your choice, and you can choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse, at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>\r\n<p>When you use your Blood Maledict, you choose which curse to invoke. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by losing a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse’s description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are immune to blood curses, unless you have amplified the curse.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Blood Maledict feature twice, at 13th level you can use it three times between rests, and at 17th level, you can use it four times between rests. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Crimson Rite</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you learn to invoke a rite of hemocraft within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose one rite from the Primal Rites list below to learn.</p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can activate a crimson rite on a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite of your choice that lasts until you finish a short or long rest, or if you aren’t holding the weapon at the end of your turn. When you activate a rite, you lose a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table.</p>\r\n<p>For the duration, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen rite’s type. This damage is magical, and increases as you gain levels as a blood hunter, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. A weapon can only hold a single active rite at a time.</p>\r\n<p>You learn an additional Primal Rite at 7th level, and access to an Esoteric Rite at 14th level.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"PrimalRites\">Primal Rites</h4>\r\n<p>Choose from the following:</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Flame.</strong></em> Your rite damage is fire damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Frozen.</strong></em> Your rite damage is cold damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Storm.</strong></em> Your rite damage is lightning damage.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"EsotericRites\">Esoteric Rites</h4>\r\n<p>Choose from the following:</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Dead.</strong></em> Your rite damage is necrotic damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Oracle.</strong></em> Your rite damage is psychic damage.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Rite of the Roar.</strong></em> Your rite damage is thunder damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Hunter Order</b></p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you commit to an order of blood hunter martial focus. Choose Order of the Ghostslayer, Order of the Profane Soul, Order of the Mutant, or Order of the Lycan, all detailed at the end of the class description. The order you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\r\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Brand of Castigation</b></p>\n<p>At 6th level, whenever you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite feature, you can choose to sear an arcane brand of hemocraft magic into it (requires no action). You always know the direction to the branded creature, and each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the creature takes psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 damage).</p>\r\n<p>Your brand lasts until you dismiss it, or you apply a brand to another creature. Your brand counts as a spell for the purposes of dispel magic, and the spell level is equal to half of your blood hunter level (maximum of 9th level spell).</p>\r\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Grim Psychometry</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 9th level, you have a supernatural talent for discerning the history surrounding mysterious objects or places touched by evil. When making an Intelligence (History) check to recall information about a darker past surrounding an object you are touching, or a location you are present in, you have advantage on the roll. The information gleaned often leans towards the more sinister influences of the past, and sometimes conveys&nbsp;visions of things previously unknown to the character on higher rolls.</p>\n\n<p><b>Dark Augmentation</b></p>\n<p>Upon reaching 10th level, arcane blood magic suffuses your body, permanently reinforcing your resilience. Your speed increases by 5 feet, and whenever you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\n\n<p><b>Brand of Tethering</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 13th level, the psychic damage from your Brand of Castigation increases to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2 damage).</p>\r\n<p>In addition, a branded creature can’t take the Dash action, and if a creature branded by you attempts to teleport or leave their current plane via ability, spell, or portal, they take 4d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the teleport or plane shift fails.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hardened Soul</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sanguine Mastery</b></p>\n<p>Upon becoming 20th level, you hone your control over blood magic, mitigating your sacrifice and empowering your capability. Once per turn, whenever a blood hunter feature requires you to roll a hemocraft die, you can choose to reroll the die and choose which result to use.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon attack empowered by your Crimson Rite, you regain one expended use of your Blood Maledict feature.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Curses</b></p>\n<p>The blood curses are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheAnxious\">Blood Curse of the Anxious</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you magnify the adrenaline in the body of a creature within 30 feet of you, making them susceptible to forceful influence. Until the end of your next turn, all creatures have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks directed at the target creature.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Amplify.</strong></em> The next Wisdom saving throw the target makes before this curse ends has disadvantage. Once you’ve amplified this blood curse, you must finish a long rest before you can amplify it again.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofBinding\">Blood Curse of Binding</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can attempt to bind a creature you can see within 30 feet of you that is no more than one size larger than you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have their speed be reduced to 0 and they can’t use reactions until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> This curse lasts for 1 minute and can affect a creature regardless of their size. At the end of each of its turns, the cursed creature can make another Strength saving throw. On a success, this curse ends.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofBloatedAgony\">Blood Curse of Bloated Agony</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you curse a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you to painfully swell until the end of your next turn. For the duration of this curse, the creature has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks, and suffers 1d8 necrotic damage if it makes more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> This curse lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the cursed creature can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, this curse ends.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofCorrosion\">Blood Curse of Corrosion</h5>\r\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 15th level, Order of the Mutant</em></p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, a creature within 30 feet of you becomes poisoned. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the curse ends.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The cursed creature suffers 4d6 necrotic damage, and suffers this damage again every time it fails its Constitution saving throw to end this curse at the end of its turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheExorcist\">Blood Curse of the Exorcist</h5>\r\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 15th level, Order of the Ghostslayer</em></p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you that is charmed, frightened, or possessed. The target creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The creature that charmed, frightened, or possessed the target of your curse suffers 3d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseofExposure\">Blood Curse of Exposure</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet is hit by an attack or spell, you can use your reaction to temporarily weaken their resilience against it. Until the end of the turn, the target loses resistance to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Amplify.</strong></em> The target instead loses invulnerability to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell, having resistance to them until the end of the turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheEyeless\">Blood Curse of the Eyeless</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll one hemocraft die and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s attack roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature’s roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll succeeds. The creature is immune if it is immune to blindness.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> You apply this curse to all of the creature’s attack rolls until the end of the turn. You roll a new hemocraft die for each affected attack.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheFallenPuppet\">Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet</h5>\r\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you drops to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to give that creature a final act of aggression. That creature immediately makes a single weapon attack against a target of your choice within its attack range.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> You can first move the cursed creature up to half their speed, and you grant a bonus to the cursed creature’s attack roll equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheHowl\">Blood Curse of the Howl</h5>\r\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 18th level, Order of the Lycan</em></p>\r\n<p>As an action, you unleash a blood-curdling howl. Each creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. If they fail their saving throw by 5 or more, they are stunned while frightened in this way. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this blood curse for the next 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the howl.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Amplify.</strong></em> The range of this curse increases to 60 feet.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheMarked\">Blood Curse of the Marked</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can mark a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. Until the end of your turn, whenever you deal rite damage to the target, you roll an additional hemocraft die of rite damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn has advantage.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheMuddledMind\">Blood Curse of the Muddled Mind</h5>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you curse a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you that is concentrating on a spell. That creature has disadvantage on the next Constitution saving throw it must make to maintain concentration before the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Amplify.</em></strong> The cursed creature has disadvantage on all Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration of spells until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"BloodCurseoftheSouleater\">Blood Curse of the Souleater</h5>\r\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 18th level, Order of the Profane Soul</em></p>\r\n<p>When a creature that isn’t a construct or undead is reduced to 0 hit points within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to usher their soul to your patron in exchange for power.
