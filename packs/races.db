An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin&rsquo;s current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The following tables offer personality suggestions for eladrin of each season.
